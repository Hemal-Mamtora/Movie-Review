{"movie": [{"movie_name": "rockstar", "review": ["not every movie needs to have tadka its a movie which is pure from heart and honest it doesnt speak about anything other than attraction which cant be explainedsure it has its flaws but if you can look over them and watch it with a warm heart it stays with you well after you have left the theater hats off to imtiaz ali for daring to break the shell jab we met was fun to watch and a good movie but rockstar shows how much depth can be reached in a romantic movie without even saying the l word even onceeverything said watch it if you appreciate good cinema and not because you are looking for a stereotypical complete bollywood package", "rockstar is a film made once in a lifetime hats off to imtiaz ali for story ranbir kapoor & nargis farkhri for scintillating performances ar rahman & mohit chauhan for great soundtrack & background musicrockstar is a must watch film itll leave you feel good hangover of itself this movie shows how love stories should be made this movie has something which is hard to see in other hindi bollywood films something which would make you think about the whole movie even after so many hours of watching it watch it deeply and youll enjoy iti loved the movie and enjoyed it thoroughly after so watching so many movies this year id say watch it again if youve seen it onceverdict dont miss itacting & performance 9 10story 85 10music 10 10overall 9 1", "first of all rockstar is not a mere love story for those people i saw drawing conclusion that this is just an extramarital affair which is justified by imtiaz ali its much more than thatwhen the character of protagonist was getting built it was told to him that it would be pain that would get the star out of him movie is journey of making of a rock star who goes through pain of separation depravity from society which makes him someone he was never meant to be but finally a rockstar a true blue eyed boy who was always away from any sense of pain in his life until he falls in love and tore apart life of his and love of his life heeri am although not a big rock music fan but got food for thought for those posthumous rock stars that lost their lives to depression and drugs this film gives gray shades of their tainted life which is always open to so much of public scrutiny which perhaps helped me to recon with their hysterical behaviorit starts with a young lad trying to make big in music but who doesnt have soul to sell himself as a serious artist he has shown a way through love and betrayal and he fancies his chances with the most admired girl of the town little does he know that this would embark an endless journey of pain for both which would see its penultimate end being both leads battling for their survival literallyi dont wish to discuss movie dynamics in length as this is not about how the script has been written with without conviction the real sense of conviction in this movie comes through ranbir kapoor he lives the character of jordan and gives performance of his life time not in for a second you would think for the entire movie that he is a movie star you would watch him struggle through his pathos kudos to him for pulling this off with such great ease i couldnt imagine anyone doing this role and leave the same impression nargis who is the leading lady in this movie looks no less than an angel in movie and gives a performance for which any new comer can feel proud about especially against such a strong character played by ranbir kapoorof all the loudest praise should go to two people ar rehman for his genius music and to mohit chauhan this movie is as much a milestone for him as it is for ranbir kapoor both mohit and ranbir jells so well that its hard to believe that actually ranbirs voice is backed by a singer its a compliment for both of them every song stands out and they all are superbi thoroughly enjoyed this journey of making of a rock star this movie is not about making a right statement to society and not to follow the footsteps of protagonist its about how much pain it goes in making a real rock star that makes everyone feel on the cloud when he couldnt ground his foot correctly movie is dark in nature and this is about an anti hero jordan who dont have sense of righteousness and he vents out his anger in form of music a picture perfect depiction of a rebel rock star to the corewatch it if you are in for dark movies dont expect any bollywood masala but an intense tide of emotions throughout", "even though the indian film industry releases countless big budget films every year only once in a while there comes a movie like rockstar which moves away from the usual story and casts an impression on the viewersimtiaz ali has created such a masterpiece this time his story is a fresh take on romance and pain and he has shown he is one of the best directors aroundthe story revolves around 2 characters janardhan jakhar aka jordanranbir kapoor and heernargis fakri and their feelings towards each other the special thing about this movie is that despite being a love story the lead characters never act as the clich\u00e9d loversthey never said i love you throughout the movie and still their love was so intense and powerfulthe self inflicted pain of jordan is the soul of this movie and moves the audienceranbir has done a remarkable act and has again proved he is an exceptional actor in the film industry his transition from the innocent and confused jj to the ruthless shattered jordan is flawless the audience were in awe of him throughout the movie and rightly sothe music blends with this movie perfectly and most of the time lifts the movie to higher levels the voice of mohit chauhan along with the expertise of ar rahman is just superb and this duo will be in demand for a long time the joy enlightenment pain and suffering of jordan is portrayed very well through the songs and this is one of those movies in which you feel that the songs werent just forced in the storydespite everything being so good there was one shortcoming nargis the model turned actress had weird expressions in few scenes in her debut film this created some funny moments in the first half but she did a convincing act post intervalone thing which the director couldnt balance was the pacethe first half was expanded into few years showing the pairs love and relationship but post interval they didnt do that and stuck to a straight and small period with longer scenes this gave most of the general audience an idea that it was slow if the story in between intervals was balanced in terms of the time span more people would have appreciated the whole moviethis an emotional and an intense journey of a simple man who goes on a path of self destruction a must watch this movie needs deep understanding and appreciation", "love stories have always been bollywoods thing a trifle here and there might have changed over the years but the formulaic love story the one that weve all grown up on and savored always takes you by the hand guides you through the films ups and downs and leaves you at an ending but when you have a story as new as fresh and as free falling as the one in imtiaz alis rockstar then these are times that herald a new change in todays bollywoodthe story goes something like this janardhan jakkadjj aka jordan a delhi simpleton has always wanted to be a rockstar his friend mentor and college canteen manager khatana gives him a get your heart broken and you will be a rockstar solution jj automatically aims for the prettiest chick on campus heer sure to have his heart broken but what follows is a story that goes from a simple one of fame mongering to a love story most unusual the chapter of jordan and heer never seems to end and their complexities take them on a path that would ultimately destroy their livesit is very difficult to characterize the movie with a single emotion it is so beautifully layered that it will take repeated viewings to form a consensus within yourself as to why you love the film just like its soundtrack rockstar is a movie you will have to allow to grow on you the film can best be described as a heady cocktail of love and fame and how each has an effect on the other its the free falling nature of the story that gives it a feeling never before experienced in indian cinema the movie borders on self indulgence every once in a while but wonderfully balances it out with realismthe music composed by ar rahman is in many ways a character in the film every phase of jordans life is characterized by a song which magically sets the tone for the next few minutes till the next song or sequence comes along and changes the mood the music in many ways drives the film its very obvious now why imtiaz ali replaced usual collaborator pritam with rahman without the type and scale of the music rahman has given for this film rockstar would have been very handicapped the music truly forms the soul of the film also from the snow covered mountains of kashmir and himachal and the dingy discotheques to the old architecture of prague and the various concert venues the film looks beautiful in almost every shot thanks to ace cinematographer anil mehta the right variations in angle color and focus gives the film a biographical feel where the scenes portray an emotion as much as the actors in them dowhich brings me to the performances the film has few characters and each of them are well defined aditi rao plays the journalist sheena who tracks jordans life and though she has precious little to do she plays her part piyush mishra as the shrewd record company owner dhingra is the quintessential greedy man in the film and does well too kumud mishra as khatana jordans old friend and manager is perfect and brings in a certain sincerity and authenticity to his part shammi kapoor as the shehnai maestro ustad jameel khan is absolutely charming every time he appears on screen it is hard to miss the glint in his eye and these being his last shots will always be what rockstar will be remembered for now for the two lead actors nargis fakri is unfortunately the weakest link in the film she obviously has a lot to learn in the acting department she blatantly disappoints in scenes where she is required to do more than just look pretty and ends up as the cold dish in rockstar nonetheless she does look good in every frame and with better acting could go places with her current form she will find it tough to make a markhowever rockstar completely belongs to ranbir kapoor who has clearly gives this film his all he plays his part with utmost perfection and with a depth that is so rare in bollywood these days through the film it is jordan and not ranbir kapoor that we see on screen he earnestly brings out the character transition from jj to jordan with such ease that this could very well be his career defining performance hes clearly left his contemporaries way behind ranbir kapoor as of now owns bollywoodhaving dared to make such an experimental film director imtiaz ali is truly the new age doyen of indian cinema his refreshing take on love stories from jab we met to love aaj kal continues with rockstar which will be remembered for a long time as the first movie of its kind truly original and truly inspired from all the right sources imtiaz ali is the new age phenomenon of modern love in cinematruly magical and spell binding rockstar leaves you with a feel good hangover of itself that is hard to digest at first watch id give it a 4 5dont miss", "even if you ignore his surname for a moment ranbir kapoor is arguably one of the most naturally talented actors in todays bollywood in addition to this his good looks ensure female fan following read rake in more moolah his rockstar may have just been his most intense and splendid performance till date rockstar begins at a concert in rome and someone scuffling with ruffians it is soon revealed that the someone is jordan a major rockstar labeled a bad boy by the media and someone who hardly smiles cut to his college days theres the simple janardan jahkar or jj strumming his guitar and singing for the local audience and his days in the college canteen gorging samosas and idolizing jim morrisonwhen his well wisher and canteen manager katana played impressively by kumud mishra tells him that a true artist needs to be driven by hurt and anguish jj curses his simple and incident free life just to get his heart broken he chases the college bombshell heer kaul nargis fakhri eventually it turns out that under the prim and proper exterior heer is thrill seeker and the two become wild friends what begins as a fun filled friendship takes different shades as the time passes on one hand heer drowns into depression without our hero whom she re christens as jordan and jordans yearning for her company brings out the performer in himin what is probably the best portrayal of what goes on in a creative head the story brings depth and makes its audience feel for jj despite the negative publicity he gets as jordan hes a simple guy who yearns for love noticeably it is only after his tryst with heer that his motive in life changes from chasing success to something else during the process success merely becomes a byproduct he is least interested in director imtiaz ali plays around with the storys chronology it is likely that the editors too may have actually lost track in between repeated scenes songs and too much of flash back or forth gets annoying after a point the restlessness among the audience was very apparent as the movie seemed to go on forever talking of performances ranbir surely has a line of awards waiting for him nargis fakhri the american with pakistani antecedents who plays the leading lady is truly beautiful and has been a kingfisher calendar girl but not as gifted with acting skills the film also marks shammi kapoors last screen appearance as he plays an ustaad who recognizes jjs talent aditi rao hydari plays a small role as a journalistar rahmans music is integral to the story and songs have already become runaway hits sadda haq kun faya kun jo bhi main with mohit chauhan as the rockstars voice and katiya karun give the album an eclectic blend of rock desi flavor and sufi mysticism again some more awards are in the waiting herecinematography too is well done especially the jerky shots and quirky angles that capture the actors emotions effectively be it the by lanes of delhi picturesque europe or breathtaking beautiful kashmir winter the excellence with the camera is undeniable the realistic costumes complement the camera work the dialog is very smart and the first half evokes laughter and stands up ably as things turn serious in the second half you may blame the script for some of its flaws but asking for perfection when portraying emotions and out of the ordinary relationships is a monumental challenge so to say its a job moderately well doneso should you be watching this movie the answer is a resounding yes granted the story gets a little lost in the second half but the rest of the goodies will make you overlook its flaws the movie is powerful enough to keep you thinking much after you are out of the movie hall if you still havent seen it go for it", "jordan is sitting among prostitutes and strumming his guitar as they sing together    when his manager pulls him out onto the street soon a crowd engulfs them and starts chanting jordans name their voices drowning the sound of the manager pleading with the musician to get his act together this is what i have always wanted jordan says looking at his screaming fans but i am not happy insideimtiaz alis rockstar is a bittersweet journey of a man an artist from being an everyman to a superstar but while ali uncovers layers off jordan the iconic musician    each layer as fascinating as it is intriguing    he keeps the core of the character janardhan jakkad alive he hurts like anybody else falls in love like anybody else and also has to deal with moments of sheer frustrationand all of it finds release in music music is jordans identity its what makes him rich and famous but to jordan thats incidental in the end his artistry is what connects him with himself for a hindi film viewer that is a fascinating story to watch unfoldthen theres the opening shot a tribute to indias original rockstar shammi kapoor from there on its a tumultuous ride \u2013 one with its highs and lows one that has anguish as also love one that has pain but also a sense of fulfillment and a brilliant finale    not a conventional one but effective nonetheless    which leaves you feeling like the characters themselves incomplete but content like an effective crescendo that leaves you wanting morethe music itself is a delight each ar rahman number is lilting and woven beautifully in the story the high frequency of songs not hindering the storytelling but enhancing the experience lyricist irshad kamil does an outstanding job penning words that reflect the lead characters state of mind and complement situations aptlyimtiaz ali in trademark fashion though isnt content with focussing on the complexities of a troubled musician he gives us a dose of romance too and a generous one at that estrangement from family lack of fulfillment in life and self discovery apart what really drives jordans music is his relationship with heer fakhri beautiful but awkward volatile as the affair is its also what keeps jordan sane and heer alivefor about 15 minutes in rockstar the narrative tends to resort to bollywoodism true love having the power to cure a terminal illness almost for example doesnt exactly fit with what the rest of the film has to say the story tends to meander a bit post interval but imtiaz makes it work eventually interweaving the fantastical romantic part of the film with the more gritty dark bits deftly in the end how much you enjoy rockstar will largely depend on whether the balance between the tale of a broken discontented musician and the more conventional love story works for youit did for me    though i would have preferred the former    but you cant deny imtiaz credit for his mastery over the romance genre no contemporary filmmaker has dealt with man woman relationships with as much dexterity his films often tread a similar path the lovers are usually confused meet at different points in life and theres always the other man but his fresh approach to each story is what makes them immensely watchablewith rockstar imtiaz goes beyond his own tried and tested format his ambition to narrating a more complex story coming through this is probably his most personal film and his honesty as filmmaker is hard not to be affected by hopefully he goes the whole hog next ditching the genre hes adept at to trying his hand at something entirely out of his comfort zone rockstar is also imtiazs most technically polished film and he benefits from the association with cinematographer anil mehta and editor aarti bajajranbir kapoor has been hindi cinemas next big thing for a while now with rockstar he lives up to the hopes pinned on him to deliver big ranbir revels in jordans complexities another actor may have found it to be an obstacle the character arc undergoes constant transformation and he adapts suitably it wouldnt be an understatement to say that ranbirs portrayal of jordan may go down as one of hindi cinemas most accomplished performances by a lead actor just to see him work his magic on screen rockstar is worth a watchbut while good acting is always an incentive its a directors vision that makes a film truly watchable and imtiaz makes rockstar stand out from what the mainstream churns out every week and brings back the one aspect sorely missing from hindi films lately    music", "prosabrupt start and unfinished endalways

farreally i always admired him as a directorand this movie  though has glimpses of his previous films that were super hits   love aajkal and jab we met but the second half is totally offbeat and different yet really refreshing the screenplay is like one i have never seen beforejust like an a grade english movie a lot of people have criticized this movie unable to understand the way imtiaz has told this story what a beautiful love story id say dont go for this movie expecting a love aajkal or jab we met  keep a free mind and enjoy imtiazs fresh way of showing you some love", "jj aka jordan   ranbir kapoor rockssaddaaaaaaaa haqqqqloved rockstar movie a lottttttttttfrom screenplay to story or direction to music n above all acting from the all the character is like mind blowing will be watching it again tomorrowthis is not a feel good movie and i know a lot of people will not like it but yes it will make you think even after the lights are onthis movie is the best film of 2011rk is amazing and arr score rocksdeserves all major awardsoverall an outstanding film which is connected to most of usrating 9 10oh ya ya ya yo yaaaaaaa", "indian cinema has matured and specially hindi film with new directors pouring in with new ideas anurag kashyap dibakar banerjee vishal bhardwaj should get special mention for their brilliant coming of age films after rockstar imtiaz ali should be added to this category of filmmakers romantic cinema is immortal perennial but never ever it has been witnessed in such creative symbolic real manner as in rockstar rockstar is journey of janarthan a regular north delhi brat who dreams of becoming jim morrison he even tries to match his initials with the famous singer and tries to change his fate alas he couldnt succeed in making a mark when a college canteen owner who becomes family for janarthan later on khataria tells him that through pain comes music janarthan took his word too seriously thus involving in a web of suffering and success all revolving around heer a lady who becomes life for janarthan rather jordan the movie is a journey of a young ambitious boy from his being janarthan to jordan and in a symbolic manner raises several questions about independence and democracy imtiaz ali is a fabulous story teller and his previous work reflects those but with rockstar he goes a level higher the film will bring polarizing reactions from cine goers but they cant ignore it probably one of the best romantic cinemas ever made ali is almost flawless in his execution with a semi non linear narrative ali goes into the psyche of jordan merging his scenario pre and post success the scene where jordan cries in front of khataria that he doesnt need all the fame he wants to be happy \u2013 sums up jordans strive with his impression the rebel has been created in a thought provoking manner raising questions to establishment the rules set in the society the willingness to live freely how power has destroyed the regular course of nature \u2013 all these ideas have been embedded subtle in a brilliant love story that is natural unlike loud melodramatic blockbusters of regular hindi cinema when jordan is almost losing heer forever there is a scene which shows jordan in a bath tub looking at his guitar on fire which reflects the life of present youth who tends to burn loss everything one loves in course of success there are many more such brilliant sequences which show alis craftsmanship as a director with able support from anil mehta the camera work is probably the best of this year ali didnt compromise for commerce and gave a surreal feel to the real proceedings kudos to aarti bajaj for her apt editing and making the film a work of art coming to the acting department ranbir kapoor rocks he camouflaged himself as jordan with \u00e9lan rockstar will prove how fine actor he is in fact the new brigade of actors should take acting lessons from ranbir watch his transition from janarthan to jordan his success his failures his love his despair \u2013 ranbirs expression deserves awards and accolades teaming up with fabulous actors like piyush mishra kumud mishra who was last seen in brilliant that girl in yellow boots ranbir showed extreme maturity in a sequence where he tore down a contract and made hysteric gestures towards piyush mishra deserves standing ovation those dialogues showing alis angst against consumerism deserves mention nargis fakhri as heer is serene beauty any boy will fall in love with her as an actress she needs to improve but then she isnt bad either piyush mishra as the opportunist dhingra simply rocks as usual kumud mishra is surely to catch attention of other directors the ensemble cast provides ample support in their brief and significant role lastly how can one forget the original rockstar late shammi kapoor in a significant appearance as a successful classical sahnai flute player he is mind blowing and how can i forget about rehmans music in the film each of the songs are mark of a genius and brilliant in their own space with awesome lyrics from irshad kamil the musical score elevates the movie to another level nadan parinday is one of the best written songs of recent times and sadda haq had all the power to be the youth anthem simply brilliant album in every sense overall rockstar is a outstanding work of art that might not appeal to every many but sure to be the next kagaz ke phool in the long run though rockstar is already a hit thankfully a genuine honest effort deserved its box office report a classic in the long run\u0085rockstar rocks", "after seeing trailer movie looking like as old movies of ranbir but this movie is surprise package for me great acting and great music with nice lyricsstory as like old movies of imtiaz ali nice and differentpeople are telling confusing might they dont have enough understandingmusic is awesomear rehman is bestlyrics is also goodbest acting of ranbir with awesome look of rockstar nargis is looking good but acting is ok shammi have very short role we can remember as a last movie of himalready watched 1 time bur wanna going for more times must watch movie go and see", "for me it was the most awaited movie for this year especially after listening to the awesome songs first of all the music rehman and irshad kamil did fabulously well the music and songs were totally different from the regular bollywood styleranbir was terrific and this was truly his best performance till date he looked so natural that sometimes you feel that you are watching a live shot documentary or somethingimtiaz alis direction as always was very good he has a different style of making movies and this movie is a great example of that though my personal favorite from his lot is love aaj kalthe only loose part in the movie was nargis she was not up to the mark and some very good scenes and situations got spoiled because of her poor acting skills and especially when pitted against the flawless ranbir she looks pathetic to say the least so without disclosing anything from the story id say its a great movie and you surely cant afford to miss it", "ranbir is committed in his disturbed desi rocker avatar and his abstention from any intoxicants makes him an idol who wouldnt corrupt his worshipers nargis blends divine beauty with lips that jive like shes in the movie finding nemowatching rockstar once is like watching it many times over thanks to the repeated montages that sporadically recap the film if you thought being stabbed once was bad heres what a knife set can dothe film drives home an unscientific hypothesis that people whove endured sufferings  heart break  loose motions etc will reach their creative best by this logic each person in the audience will be blessed with superhuman creativity as they step out after watching rockstar oh yeah yeah yeah go n watch out u cant miss d ", "this is seriously imtiazs best film yet when the movie end i kept asking myself how is it possible to narrate a story like this story wise absolutely amazing what you guys will see in the trailer is just 1% of the movie ranbir kapoor was amazing too balancing the right emotions at the right time some amards should be waiting for him now definitely ar rahman stole the whole movie with 14 top charting music every music suits the story every single time well he isnt called genius without a reasonfor me its the best album of the year and potentially the best movie if the year all credits goes to imtiaz ali for such great story content", "lately i have had to go through the trauma of watching some rubbish money motivated bollywood flicks such as the prolonged bodyguard and the hideously scripted ra onehowever rock star is just on another level it is the most gripping bollywood film of the year it reminds me of movies like rock on dil chahta hai rang de basanti because this like them is not a clich\u00e9d story it is out of the box and very very different from the monotonous chocolate love flicksthe best part of the movie was that there were no non sense songs all the songs made sense and were perfectly timed the music by ar rehman is absolutely brilliant apart from that it is very well directed the way the director has played with the time line is marvelous the time line keeps the viewer glued to the screen for instance the start of the movie is showing jj or jordan at a massive concert and then suddenly you see him as a struggling visionary artist during his college life trying to imitate famous rock starsyes the movie basically is a love story but an extremely gripping one unlike most bollywood love stories you see how jordan becomes the star he is due to this love story that is what makes it so special 2 plots working side by side complementing one another ie him becoming a star due to his passionate love affairthe facial expressions of both ranbir and nargis add to the spice you actually feel they are in love the intensity of their relationship is very evident due to the acting nargis despite not having her own voice has done an outstanding job and ranbir kapoor has stepped up a notch from his other brilliant performance in rajneetiit is one of those epic movies you cant afford to miss if you are a fan of wonderfully scripted biographies then this one is definitely for you however if you enjoy over the top action stunts or illogical comedy then dont watch itmy recommendation to all purists out there do watch it i cant believe the rating of this movie is only 76 which is most likely to dropthrough all this i have learned one thing through this movie the indian cinema has shown signs of maturity however through the rating the public has notranbir kapoor and nargis take a bow  extremely brilliant performance ", "film when you think about a film by imtiaz ali you only see an entertainment tag to a film and also very good script writing but seeing the promos of rockstar made me think what imtiaz is up to now after giving a great film like jab we met and a mediocre film like love aaj kal i was expecting a cheesy love story with a good entertaining factor i wont say this movie doesnt have any cheesiness but yes its in a very low dosage people going for just entertainment will actually love half of the movie people going to see a romantic flick will love the whole film there are some very good comic punches in the film and some very humiliating parts too i wont use any spoilers but yes the first half is full of comic scenesacting ranbir kapoor is at his best here after giving a great performance in rajneeti this guy has shown his serious part again in more of sadder way nargis fakhri is very good to look at most part of the film you will just look at her and wont even hear what anybody is saying but when you see her talking the jaw just falls down she does not have those acting skills at all its like the start of katrina kaif again but she has a great future ahead of her for sure kumud mishra and piyush mishra never disappointed in their acting both did a great job especially piyush mishradirection & cinematography now the direction was really top notch in this movie it was particularly flawless in every aspect imtiaz has a tendency to deepen the character development and he has done this with great enthusiasm the character development of the rockstar is very good and keeps you on your seat the cinematography was also great from the walking sides of delhi university to the scenarios of kashmir and prague was immensely intriguingstory the story of the movie had some parts that all hindi romantic have usually for a time you would wonder of a yash raj film being shown but the turn of events and the whole movement of the story were good the only problem being that the whole movie was a drag stretch this movie if made shorter would have gained more audiencemusic i would say the music by ar rahman is damn good from jo bhi main to tum ho the scores are really beautiful and stays in your head for a very long time sadda haq already being the favorite among the youth has a good adrenaline rush factor in it the movie being pretty much mediocre the music actually makes the movie very goodverdict i would go forfilm 7 10acting 7 10direction & cinematography 6 10story 6 10music 9 10overall 75 10the movie has been given a great artistic touch to it which is hard to see in a bollywood film such that it makes you think about the whole movie even after 24 hours of watching it give it time to indulge in your mind it will actually get to your soft spot and you would say the movie was really sad", "rockstar is a beautiful painting on a canvas its a journey through the soul of a musician mellow and bitter sweet its not a feel good movie or even an actual tale it has gaps as glaring as a 30 foot wide goal post but rockstar has a soul and that keep you fixed to the screen long after the goal i liked rockstar for three reasons ar rahman the visuals and ranbir kapoor a r rahman has weaved magic and the music would be stuck in your head long after the movie saddha haqis raw and full of energy and will gets your fists pumping in the air the visuals are simply scintillating there would definitely be more indians holidaying in prague and kashmir now anil mehta deserves the kudos for the cinematography kashmir will take your breath away but the lapses quickly bring it back rockstar has great humor its refreshing to see bollywood have well written clean and neat humor its funny and does leave you in splits the ideology that only pain begets music is a little retarded though the movie progresses at its own pace with the music and visuals rockstar is not a statement or even the tale of most rock stars it just isar rahman music is alone worth going to the film soulful and very sufi in nature the 14 tracks in the movie are simply a testament to the genius he is the rawness of the music has an addictive aura to it and will mesmerize you ranbir kapoor i must say has matured into a fine young actor with \u00e9lan and crisp he blends the several layers of his character seamlessly into one hes not acting hes living it imitaz ali has definitely grown as a director since jab we met & love aaj kal rockstar is loosely based on a friend of his but he manages to pen it right this is definitely not his best work but it pulls through what you will find hard to digest is the logic used that leaves you numb aarti bajaj could have edited rockstar better to make it edgy but you would not want to change that because you would risk hurting the soul of rockstar nagris fakri is the new katrina kaif and has done an outstanding job considering that this is her debut shammi kapoor spoke with his eyes and what a tribute it was to him rockstar is no dabaang or singham not a movie for the masses but it appeals to you rb has the charm to keep you stuck to the screen frankly rockstar could be the perfect cure for the ra one hangover its not a great movie but it will suffice to rid of the week its a half baked chocolate cake who cares its chocolate anyway baked or half baked", "watch it for ar rahmans heart touching songsextraordinary performance

is an enchantment to watch that how indian cinema is up and coming with some different subject matterjanardan jakhadjj a regular lad with vehemence for rock music and die hard fan of jim morrison goes to an indistinct length he was recommended by his mentor that to become an eminent artist there must have occurred a catastrophe and pain deep in heart the efforts to break his heart are very funny with some witty dialogs and great body language by ranbir eventually nargis fakhris screen presence is a cool breeze she is striking but lacks in the acting skills she missed the expressions and unable to deliver nevertheless having a counterpart role the supporting cast has done very well special mention for kumud mishra katara & piyush mishra dhingrathe first half of the movie shows the character development of jj with some fine moments of mirth and splendid cinematography however the second half drags a bit with some no obvious reason deeds ranbir adds a new feather is his cap with outstanding performance he shows a great potential in every movie with a different shade he is going to take the kapoors legacy to a whole new level ultimately the music given by our own oscar winner a r rahman is exceptional and soul of the movie every score is blazing with the correct situation rahman is a genius and kudos for compiling such stupendous music which will remain in our hearts until the world ends imtiaz ali has given us some fantastic movies including his best my opinion socha na tha and with rockstar he chooses a very fine and daring subject waiting to see more from himmusic 95 10 acting ranbir 8 10 story 6 10 direction & cinematography 7 10film   75 1", "first up i want to say as a gleeful child i sat in the theater and wanted to give as much chance as possible to like rockstar because i was mesmerized by the sheer musical brilliance of arr that being said even if i went in with a hate mood its difficult not to like this imperfect masterpiece imperfect not in the way it was handled but its an imperfect story about an imperfect man inside every star first half there are three main things for a life to sustain a creator a soul and a body to host the soul and thats where rockstar is blessed in having a brilliant director in imtiaz as its creator a soul in arr and the surprisingly perfect body to host in ranbir people who didnt like ranbir for the rich spoiled kid he is must realize if he has this much acting talent he can be as much spoiled he can be  the story is simple its the life and lies of janardhan jakhar aka jordan its how a innocent guitarist who wants to make big goes throe pain and when he becomes popular that same pain engulfs him so much that he doesnt know how to handle it credit has to be given to the director for creating two wonderfully unique halves that are so diff from each other the first is about the wonderfully tender relationship between janardhan and heer its so innocent and realistic that the first half flows as faultless as a river about the heroine narghis fakhri i agree she has been the real letdown in this film but her acting was not bad as such she was shown up by the beast of an actor opposite to her who was living the role of his life in ranbir second half now coming to the second half the half which many did not like it speaks up about the ordinary guy in jordan the star wanting for thing to be as simple as it was when he wasnt a star its complex i agree and it glorifies a lot about infidelity which is still the unspeakable when it comes to indian cinemas but its brave its new and it definitely touched me i have seen countless movies brilliant till climax and faltering in it and when dealing with a movie as complex as this i could see imtiaz coming up with 100s of ending for this but in the end he played to safe made it a musical tribute to that janardhan jakhar inside jordan advantages of having an open ended climax is that it lets us decide what we want and in the end keeps everyone happy but being brought up with bollywood the indian inside us wants the director to end it one way or other another reason why open ended climaxes rarely work in bollywood coming to acting of other cast its difficult to single out anyone in particular because every frame was so dominated by ranbir but kumud mishra  katana bhai pips over nargis just because of the chemistry he shares with ranbir odd to say a third person has more of a chemistry with the hero than heroine but thats the sort of unique film this is now i conspicuously avoided mention about the music till now because the sheer f**king brilliance of arr deserves a separate paragraph now titling a movie rockstar everything could go wrong with the music but arr showed us how everything can be made right with it how every gap can be filled how every untold story can be told and how an untold climax can be ended now i surprisingly had the privilege of watching this movie is escape with english subtitles and that for me made all the difference from making this a nice film to a masterpiece starting from the summary of the hero in jo bi mein to the mild subtle variations of katiya karun as the lead pairs relationship to the beautiful parallelism in hawa hawa to the wonderful connection between coming of age song sadda haq and the climax song naadan parindey to the haunting back ground musics of tum ho and aur ho arr has lived and breathed life in every frame of the movie i have seen countless indian movies never have i seen a theater full of audience sing along with every song only the brilliance of arr turned the usually etiquette filled sathyam audience into a maniacal rockstar audience i read in an interview with arr that he and imtiaz spent 3 years in conversation about this movie and its music and this kind of movie deserves that depth as the end credits roll on we see the lead couple romance in all the places they have been since the start of the movie and to have that vision of how to end the movie when beginning to shoot shows imtiazs vision this is that kind of movie which i can type endlessly about the story plot but i cannot do justice to that movie experience you get sitting inside the theater verdict another indian movie that is too futuristic for its generation too complex to understand and too imperfect to be loved another movie i hate to see get flopped but destined for it anyway a movie to be watched in a theater worthy of handling its musical nuances and with an open mind and with english subtitles for no obs like me", "rockstar is one of the best

bollywood icons cameo in the film isnt moreover writer director imtiaz alis sensibility ensures that rockstar for the most part steers well clear of the clich\u00e9s that usually hound the average bollywood love storythough there are many flaws in the movie but ranbir with his performance covers it up verdict   awesome movies guys just watch it ratings   9 10", "i have to say that watching this movie alone in an empty movie theatre added several dimensions to the whole experience of watching rockstar my first comment is to imtiaz ali   what were you thinking bro to actually have the gumption to create a love story around the idea of ethereal and eternal love as envisioned by the great sufi master rumi in the land of dabangg and bodyguard did you really think that audiences read the common man would throng cinemas and multiplexes to get a taste of sublime lovefor sublime love is the thread that binds this beautiful bitter sweet tale together it is a love story written in the idiom of northindian kashmiri sufi culture of dargahs of spirituality of delhi university campus insider jokes of the topography of north india especially kashmir and i fear the film could be condemned with the e word  elitism the starting point of the story is a young ordinary low middle class callow youth who is a wannabe singer strumming his guitar to ordinary lyrics hoping to make it big he is accused of being shallow by his mentor and advised to seek out pain in order to light the creative spark that divine glow that accompanies great art unbeknownst to him his casual and frivolous flirtation with this search for angst leads him into the deep end where he has to come face to face first with true love and then with the inevitable pain that comes with it the dialogues are fabulous so is the cinematography the snow clad mountains of kashmir and the misty mornings of new delhi the green fields full of flowers in prague place the story in the here and now when in truth the story could belong to any era any century any epoch the universality of love the self realisation that comes with it the realisation that this life is but a dream is what the movie is really about the essence of the story is not in the physicality of love but love beyond the here and now beyond right and wrong and love for the creator who was there when there was nothing elsesee what i mean when i ask imtiaz  what were you thinking bro and now for the piece de resistance the music the lyrics the singer if there were any doubts being expressed by the hoi polloi about a r rehmans diminishing creativity well then here is his rebuttal the music is earthy rooted in our traditions and culture and designed to rock its astonishing how rehman is able to dive into the musical traditions of the punjab to create the saada haq and katiyaan karoon irshad kamils lyrics if you take the time to listen to the songs and understand the words are beyond compare mohit chauhans voice is eminently suitable for all the songs my favorite is naadaan parinde ghar aajaa listen to the lyrics and cry we have been enjoying a lot of junk food lately now its time for some haute cuisine", "the concept of presenting the strength of music has been totally upgraded and has been lifted to a great level \u0085 a r rehman has proved and ensured that not always audience can take a break during any song sequence in indian bollywood movie i would love to see a live sadda haq of mohit \u0085 duet of rehman and mohit in kun faya kun & nadan parinde deserve top marksi didnt went for this movie with any great expectation but the direction in first 10 15 mins of the movie gave my money back \u0085 rest was just free of cost world class entertainmentvery first thing i did after i was back from the movie was i checked the profile of imtiaz ali what a direction and script mr director \u0085 it might not appeal to masses but is surely a feast for music lovers and phenomenal acting as in how well a character can be presented it was like rocky on adrenaline \u0085 not a single moment in the movie was getting drown down \u0085 one perfectly executed scripti was fed up with all those hollywood remakes \u0085 but this presentation was really impressive all stars to rockstar", "rockstar saddaaa haq finally after a long time bollywood present just gr8 movie just an awsm movie this is calling must watch movie if u dont watch u miss really gr8 make by imtiaz ali boss rock & music hmmmmm just tremendous work by ar rehmaaaan & mohit chauhan rock and also ranbeeeer kapoor doing such a fabulous

must watch if u dont like movie i pay for it  promise dont miss  rockstar is a film made once in a lifetime i thoroughly enjoyed this journey of making of a rock star this movie is not about making a right statement to society and not to follow the footsteps of protagonist its about how much pain it goes in making a real rock star that makes everyone feel on the cloud when he couldnt ground his foot correctly movie is dark in nature and this is about an anti hero jordan who dont have sense of righteousness and he vents out his anger in form of music a picture perfect depiction of a rebel

criticism and go see it for yourself", "im a 75 yr old gramma that saw this movie with her son and grandson we all loved it\ni heard queen music as i worked and raised my 4 children but never really knew the band it came from\nmy children lived with queen music and totally identified with them especially in their band performances\nmy grandson heard queen because his father played it all the time\nwe saw this movie as a family and the movie was about family friends and loyalty the typical band movie is about rising to fame falling from fame this movie is about hanging together as family as loyal friends something we really need more of today the 2 15 time frame flies by and youre left wanting moremore more\nrami malek is awesome as freddie he his 3 co stars last director music

blown after watching the world premiere yesterday evening i am whether a megahuge queen fan although i really like many of their songs nor do i know how accurate the storytelling is  but i suppose pretty accurate since both brian may and roger taylor are co producers of the film but i found the movie both intoxicating and moving i have read some of the professional reviews and i cannot comprehend their search of documentary wisdom in this movie this is not a documentary but an entertaining story of one of the worlds most iconic bands and the film delivers on all aspects and the critics were so wrong about the song bohemian rhapsody upon its releaseas brian may pinpointed in the interview on the red carpet he found that the casting was excellent i dont remember the exact word he used but he is so right every major role is perfectly casted and all the band members are brilliant but i must emphasize rami maleks role as freddie it has oscar written all over it what he does is almost beyond comparison chapeau for even taking on this role and then delivering what he does even better although marginally than michael douglas in behind the candelabra and gwilym lee as brian may is also a bulls eye but malek really carries the production on his tiny shoulders it was like watching our beloved freddie all over againmany many memorable moments but the live aid performance recreated it is one of the best scenes i have ever seen   and i have seen lots and lots of films chapeau for directors and producers and the whole team for to me delivering the best film ytd in 2018", "i dont know how to elaborate more than this if you are 35 and younger you will understand after seeing this movie", "my wife and i both enjoyed this immensely we are queen fans and attended the tribute concert a after freddie diedthis film is extraordinary first and foremost for rami maleks performance the physical resemblance is only a small part of that he had freddies body language down to a teebut the crowning glory is the vocals they are absolutely mind blowing i dont know how they did it im assuming its freddies voice the lip sync is flawless if its malek singing the oscar is in the bagive heard there are some negative reviews floating around i find that astonishing i hope malek gets at least a few nominations for this he should get multiple awards", "i just saw the world premiere and oh boy let me tell you about itthis movie might not be a masterpiece but my heart is filled with such happiness and joy after watching it that i think its going to burst sorry for the cheesiness freddie mercury brian may roger taylor and john deacon are so exquisitely portrayed i sometimes forgot it wasnt them the performances were so on point and so powerful you could feel the energy burst through the screen \u00bfhave you seen the famous car scene in waynes world well now imagine a full room doing the same people couldnt help but sing along lets be honest its impossible not tooi laughed cried sang and wished i could have seen queen live this band will live forever", "this movie was a brilliant portrayal of the mixed up life and massive talent that was mercury  and that is in no way meant to diminish the other fabulous musicians who made up this wonderful band whilst freddies life and death are quite well documented his inner turmoil is not   this movie opens this up for all to see and highlights actions and individuals who had a large influence on his fragile life both good and horrendously bad if only he could have been happy with the knowledge that he had one of the best singing voices if not the best that ever fronted a rock band rami malek does a wonderful job of portraying him and in so many ways has captured his mannerisms to a tee loved it and listening to the music in an imax auditorium was brilliant", "for those of us of a certain age queen and especially freddie defined us sitting through this movie i had goosebumps the casting just works and watching the actors playing may and deacon youd be forgiven in thinking someone had access to a time machine even kenny everett was instantly recognisable\ni left this movie a strange combination of elated and terribly sad elated to hear the music watch the story and yet sad that freddie was so desperately lonely\nultimately i think freddie would have approved of the whole thing his genius and flamboyance shone through\ntruly brilliant", "rami malek will be forever one of my favorite actors since the day ive watched mr robot i knew he will be one of the biggest star someday freddie mercury is legend everyone loves him but not everyone knows his story freddy mercury is fearless but not everyone knows about his desperately lonely i dontt know how accurate the storytelling is but this movie is absolutely mind blowing and brilliant such a perfect tribute to the legendim not saying this movie is perfect or masterpiece infact this movie has some issues with the director and delayed but after i walk out of the theater my heart is filled with joy tears of happiness brought so many emotions thats how you know the movie is fantastic darling the casting was brilliant bravo i cant get enough with rami malek he obviously worked so hard rami malek pulls off an amazing performance he just brings freddie back to life and i dont think you will see any better film about freddie mercury again its an oppurtunity of a lifetime every aspects of this movie was executed beautifully also the whole cast was so close to perfection gwilym as brian may ben as roger and joseph

different is ok as long as you are you\nthe film brought so many emotions   laughter sadness joy   very heart warming\nat times i forgot i wasnt actually watching the guys from queen   they all looked so like them   especially may and mercury\ni thought rami rocked the role massive respect to this guy\nwould happily pay to go back in and watch it again my film of 2018", "i love it when it happens again and again\ncritics are too lost in their purist world to see something well done\njust watch the movie it is worth your time", "quite simply the critics are wrong this is a fitting tribute to

ever remember my dad crying was when freddie died that love for queen has been passed on to my little boy so off we went a little disheartened i might add following the critic reviews to watch the movie ten minutes in my little boy turned to me and said  mum i love this already the film has you right from the get go i honestly dont know what movie those critics saw but it cant have been the same movie at times i forgot i wasnt watching the real queen i laughed i cried i got goosebumps i cried some more i absolutely loved every minute of it the cinema was packed out and as the credits drew the audience clapped and cheered something i have never experienced at a movie before do not be put off just go if you have kids take them too", "what a night this was i went to the world premiere in my local theatre with the purple carpet event on the big screen and all that jazzwhen i saw the first trailer i didnt think much about rami malek as freddie or the whole movie at all since the majority of biopics are generic and pretty much formulaic back then i even considered dropping sacha baron cohen a huge mistake but boy was i wrong malek shined like hes never shone before i think susie figgis outdid herself as a casting director hereever since i joined the casting industry i really started seeing what it means to work here how important this part of showbiz that is and how just a single miscast can ruin a project susie figgis is a veteran casting director known for many big and widely loved projects and she did well here she did extremely well up until the moment i joined this business i paid little to no attention to the actor ensemble with the exception of clear miscasts that just stood out and you couldnt unsee it but yesterday i just sat there mesmerized gwilym lee did an outstanding job portraying brian may in fact i forgot he wasnt him lucy boynton was one of my absolute favorites portraying mary austin and her love and devotion towards freddie and rami malek oh boy rami *was* freddie mercury while i was sitting there in the theatre and staring at the screen i didnt have a feeling i was watching actors play their parts i felt like i was watching queeni dont have much to say about the plot or the costumes the setting the cast everything was close to perfection a perfect balance of drama and comedy exactly how life isi was five when my dad came to me kneeled put his large and on my tiny shoulder and delivered the tragic news about freddie passing queen was basically the soundtrack of my upbringing so i didnt take the news too well i wept like ive just lost a dear friend dad and i spent the remainder of that afternoon blasting the tracks we oh so lovedqueen has been the soundtrack of my life therefore its impossible to have an unbiased opinion about rhapsody but i must admit i had my reservations at first but in the end i loved it the last twenty minutes of the film i spend sobbing and wiping the tears and mascara tracks from my cheeks i cant remember the last time i cried this much in a movie and i dont know if it was the music freddies tragic fate or the relationships he had both with lovers and his family or maybe it was an amalgam of everything but from the first minutes the movie started building up it rose block by block until the huge skyscraper that the story was finally concluded and all the lights turned on and it shined like a marvelous gemuntil this day live aid remains the biggest most epic music event in the history of civilization and it is remembered by millions and _bohemian rhapsody_ did it justice malek did justice to freddie and i left my seat long after the credits had stopped rolling the show must go on and it does", "just watched bohemian rhapsody with my wife my 16 yo daughter and 14 yo son its quite simply one of the best movies weve ever seen rami maleks performance as freddie mercury is phenomenal and worthy of an oscar the other actors are great too the music is naturally magnificent were talking of queen after all we rated bohemian rhapsody 10 10", "after listening to the reviews calling bohemian rhapsody a bog standard bio i think its time for me to put my two cents in to the ringpersonally i must have been watching another movie or is that i just understood what the makers of bohemian rhapsody were trying to achieveactually lets start with just thatbohemian rhapsody is a tribute to the legacy of freddie mercury and also the band queen it was primarily made for the fans of the the band and to showcase the band and its history to a new audienceto do this the film primarily uses a straight forward story telling style this also means that events and time lines have to be condensed and fictionalised to tell that story in just over 2 hours this also means that many real characters have to amalgamate in to a couple of fictional personas i personally had no problem with this i also liked the fact that the film poked fun at future events using also comic casting those who have seen the movie will know what im talking about\nit seems to me that the critics wanted something that real queen fans have no real time for namely a movie that explores freddies wild private life we know what he did we know a lot about his wild side but queen fans want a film about the most important elements of freddies life namely the band and its musicbohemian rhapsody does something betterinstead of showing a debauched indulgent life bohemian rhapsody instead shows us a man trying to come to terms with his extraordinary life it shows how with the help of the truly talented other members of queen he was able to do that it also shows his joy his loneliness plus some of his mistakes and missteps along the way and of course his complex relationship with mary astor possibly the one person he truly lovedit tackles his sexuality and some of the aftermath of his partying it also shows the beginning of his illness this is all achieved with sensitivity and respectnow for the musicbohemian rhapsody is possibly at its greatest when recreating queen on stage using a mixture of real singing from the actors queen and freddies over dubbing and sound alike artists to create a totally unique feel to queens songs recreations of the bands greatest hits are mixed to sound fresher than ever some even help the movie to move along showing headlines and critics reviews as the songs play out then theres the live aid performance much like the real concert it almost dwarfs everything that has gone before on film we the audience really get to experience what it was like to be at that event not just from the crowd but from the bands point of view almost every highlight from that performance is featuredthe performanceseveryone agrees rami malek is a revelation as freddie after about 20 minutes you totally forget that this is an actor he is freddie this can also be said for gwilym lee ben hardy and joseph mazzello playing the rest of the band in fact in the case of lee the transformation into brian may is astounding as the film primary focuses on freddie you can feel a sorry that aspects of the other members of the band arent fully explored rogers womanising is hinted at but brians private life and his relationship with his father are not john deacon remains the enigma of the band\nlucy boynton gives a carefully measured and sensitive performance as mary astor coming to terms with the changes in freddies life\nunfortunately allen leech has the unenviable task of playing a composites of some of freddies lovers and can be seen as a bit of a cliche villain but he gives a good account of himself\nas for the rest of the cast everyone else is solidthe film begins with live ad and ends on that same dayif youre a fan of queen i defy you to leave your seat as the credits role\nto sum up bohemian rhapsody is a celebration not an expose and it should be treated that way by those pay their money to see it\nthe critics obviously didnt get it", "ok its the opening day the cinema is packed probably 90% queen fans the fans ranged from a young girl of about 10 to old gits like medemi malek is awesome throughout he obviously worked so hard to not just look but to sound and act like freddie then again they all didthere have been some negative professional reviewer comments and i did read them and i really couldnt work out what they wanted   perhaps a mix of philadelphia story and mama miathe complex relationship between freddie and mary austin as well as paul prenterband finally jim hutton was explored and dealt with appropriate sensitivitypersonally i felt it was short and would have loved to peek more behind the curtain to understand where the music that shaped my adolescence came fromif youve never seen it go to youtube and watch the queen performance at live aid the reaction of the crowd wasnt overplayed it was if anything understatedby the way bryan singer is credited as director but he left and dexter fletcher stood in and made a pretty good jobwant to see it agai", "wow what a brilliantly made film brian singer the usual suspects x men has walked a sublime tightrope of a wonderful engaging funny and emotional film without turning it into a turgid hollywood smarm fest rami malek is of course the star and his performance as freddie is uncanny most of the vocals were freddies originals but he does attempt some of his ownwith commendable success and you quickly forget its not actually mr mercury himself\nunlike some biopics the music itself does by no means fall by the wayside and there is a multitude of queen classics crammed into the just over 2 hours running time and with roger taylor and brian may as the executive music producers for the film expect nothing less i was pleasantly surprised as to how much of the movie was dedicated to the music and if i wasnt in a cinema i would have spent half the time air guitaring and singing at the top of my voice of course we have a lot of the film dedicated to freddie and his declining social life behavior and ultimately health and this is handled with so much respect and emotion that at no point does it seem forced or uncomfortable\nthe film follows a classic rise fall and rise again formula culminating in a final fist pumping rousing half hour which sees the band bust out what some say is the greatest live performance of all time as they re emerge for wembleys live aid concert\nrealistically the film wont go down as an all time classic and may not be up for any oscars except for maleks performance maybe but what we do get is a barnstorming foot tapping heart pumping movie which for me is without a doubt one of the greatest music biopics ever made go see it", "love of my life11 10 in short this film is superbnow ive got that out of the way   the theme is lovelove of a friends  love of a man for a woman and man for man love of a family love of work colleagues  love and adoration and the search of love for oneselfbe prepared its an emotional roller coaster   its a film of dreams hopes and aspirations and the ups and downs all of that encompasses  its a film about trust and deceit  its about a maverick and it is about mavericks that make them uniquethis couldnt have been done any better  i personally hate films longer than 100 minutes but after 137 minutes i waited till the end of the credits and wanted an encore i think the success of this film will see a raft of musical biopics   rocketman about elton john comes out next year  and im sure someone will make one about george michael  prince  david bowie  michael jackson  marc bolan the list is long  and i could even see a remake of pink floyd the wall with a story and dialogue in there rather than relying on the music and animation of the 1982 version you probably know the story and you know the end but it handles the life of freddie mercury and queen from their beginning in 1970 till the highlight of live aid in 1985 and fifteen year period of rise and fall and return to superstardom   i want it all and i want it now rip freddie 1991   you were so loved  you are still loveddedicated to mary austin the love of his

makes sure the audience is hooked dialogue writer vijay maurya also played by muradranveers uncle wrote some amazing dialogues and a script that not only neatly ties on the gully boy himself but his love interest relationships with his family friends and his inner demons\nranveer has slowly become indians daniel day lewis there is no trace of him in murad he is sensitive daring intense and quiet

the whole movie is based in dharavi\neveryone is good with their character and it was great to see vijay raaz as always he is indeed a very good actor\nto the one who dont understands the rap culture the movie will be quite overrated but trust me its not\nto the one saying the movie is a copy of 8 miles must watch the movie this is how the story of rapper can be exactly displayed\nand ranveer was outstanding with his part and apna time aayega is just outstanding work by ranveer if you feel the character then its also an inspiring story\naccording to me its definitely worth watching \nand the one calling ranveer singhs character as overacting are the one who dont understand mumbais local languag", "must watch direction screenplay acting everything is good in this movi", "this is a perfect

you stupid morons every part of the movie was awesome", "a story which justifies the hype it created before even releasing theres alot to the other than just big names the contribution of zoya akhtars whole team is brilliant and is visible throughout the film has a gripping narrative it has a lot of parallel stories which are quite clear due to zoyas brilliant directing ranveer singh and alia bhatt have delivered great performances which were expected siddhant chaturvedi is also a delight to watch the authenticity of the film if commendable", "gully boy is a journey of journeys full of words visuals expressions lyrics and story lines you the viewer get to focus on elements that appeal to your senses and take out as much or as little as you want out of it there are innumerable reviews and articles on great performances and catchy rap songs and its all true\nso instead of repeating the same let me focus on some of the masterfully crafted journeys where you accompany the characters and open different dimensions of emotions and people who are just like us its long full of spoilers but no apologiesvery skilfully we are conveyed how murads ranveer singhs world is dark almost claustrophobic before he gets to taste some success notice the lights celebrations and reflections around him when hes sitting alone in darkness on a new years eve as a hesitant driver in a carin the same job and two different journeys murad comes face to face with the life of more affluent youth and it somehow tells him about his own struggle in first instance his boss is told off for giving up on education and how he himself with his hopes of being a graduate will still just leave him at the lowest wrung of society\nin the other while his boss is crying in the backseat of the car his pathos gushes out in the form of rap lyrics about how our social class structure prohibits him from reaching out just a few inches across and offer some solacethere are rides with murad and other youth just like him stealing cars   at times for money and at other just for joyrides maybe just taking out their angst of belonging to the have nots class and being stuck with it   naukar ka beta hamesha naukar rahega no matter how hard they try\nanother brief scene of a bored looking multitude of people in local train drives home the point   this is how you end up if you are born poor   just one in millions and no hope being any betterthen there are the bus journeys with safeena alia bhatt which beautifully convey how the only way to hide their relationship is in plain sight in public transport in a society as hypocritical and divided as india thats true for many other couples as welland then there is the more deserved joyride for murad with sky kalki koechlin in her car this time he is exposed to what a rich affluent minority thinks is wrong with the world and then we realise what the so called educated class doesnt get   multitudes of people like murad are still struggling with the lack of basics   roti kapda makaan and now maybe internet tooat the end of same journey we get to see a more pronounced flaw in murad that makes him all the more human   he sort of cheats on his girl friend of 9 years in the directors own words   why wouldnt he  after all its his chance of crossing over and be with a person from the other side of society which otherwise wouldnt even acknowledge his presenceits a four and half stars from meps so far i thought ranveer was just another overrated wannabe but he proves himself a worthy actor with this movie in case you happen to read this an apology first and then well done ranveer", "zoya akhtar has done it again after helming some brilliant films like luck by chance zindagi na milegi dobara and the underwhelming dil dhadakne do zoya changes

0.2681570378026748}, {"movie_name": "avengers:infinitywar", "review": ["over the past decade marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt the studio has consistently delivered smart funny brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic book origins the 18 blockbuster movies produced since iron man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre   theyve helped to legitimise it indeed marvels two most recent films   thor ragnarok and black panther   have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks and yet its perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about avengers infinity war this is a blockbuster film thats been ten years in the making its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies it features 30 or so characters each with their own complex backstories and motivations and all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe it sounds ridiculous and feels impossible but thats precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement masterfully directed by anthony and joe russo infinity war is bold brainy filmmaking at its very best the kind that will lift your spirits blow your mind and shatter your soul   occasionally in the same scene it demonstrates on an epic scale what marvel has known all along that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story for all its blockbuster spectacle and theres almost too much of that the film works because its anchored by the heart humour and humanity of its charactersthe films basic plot is simple thanos played via motion capture by josh brolin intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction has long been on the hunt for the six infinity stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe he dispatches his acolytes to earth to retrieve the time stone currently in the possession of dr stephen strange benedict cumberbatch and carve the mind stone out of the forehead of vision paul bettany its a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes weve come to know and love   from the avengers to the guardians of the galaxy   must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe from the outset its immediately clear that neither the films directors nor screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely are interested in playing it safe most other superhero films are bled of high stakes   the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma but its a super safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive theres no such guarantee here within the first ten minutes we are confronted with the dark twisted depths to which thanos and his acolytes in the black order will sink in order to achieve their goals death as well as genuine loss and sacrifice is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives infinity war ever forward and the film is all the better for it thats not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience whats so impressive about infinity war is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods when its funny and it very often is its deeply truly funny the film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon mixing and matching ones youd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter peter quill chris pratt is floored by thors chris hemsworth godly muscles bruce banner mark ruffalo is charmed by the wit and intelligence of shuri letitia wright and itd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by peter dinklages inspired cameo its a blithely tongue in cheek sensibility shared by marvels best comic books which understand that humour can make you care when it really countsand boy does infinity war make it count there are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film from the charming surrogate father son dynamic shared by tony stark robert downey jr and peter parker tom holland to the undeniable love that ties vision and wanda maximoff elizabeth olsen together in many ways the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love but to love fiercely and beyond all logic its right there when the unfailingly noble steve rogers chris evans declares we dont trade lives even when giving up one could save billions theres even a chilling echo of it in thanos himself a lesser film would have turned thanos into a one dimensional villain much the way hes all monster and maniac in the comic books in infinity war however thanos end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today there is as it turns out method to thanos madness it makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters gamora zoe saldana and nebula karen gillan all the more unsettling for the most part infinity war does justice too to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film the russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in captain america civil war and they do so again here with twice as many characters even the most minor of supporting players like don cheadles james rhodes war machine are given story beats that land it helps that marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight even so there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast emotionally speaking this is downeys film he plays every note of tonys reluctant courage and bone deep trauma as he embarks on what hes convinced is a suicide mission hes ably matched by cumberbatch who finds vulnerability even in his characters most cunning and calculative move hemsworth meanwhile is given free rein to import the big hearted comedic swagger of thor ragnarok into this film   while also layering it with a deeply felt jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of thanos and the universein a film with so many moving parts some elements dont work quite as well a couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront   including an original avenger or two   fade into the background the film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene and while most of them are fantastically choreographed there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent thanos from clenching his fist in effect this is a superhero m\u00eal\u00e9e thats part over the top and part overkill and might prove too much for those who dont already care for this franchise and the characters in itminor quibbles aside though infinity war is yet another step in the right direction for marvel it continues the studios tradition of placing a premium on rich complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences but it also refuses to make things easy for itself the film ends even more bravely than it began with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure its a stroke of bold brilliant genius   a narrative risk so audacious that youll want to follow marvel wherever it goes next", "this movie is the beginning of the culmination of marvels masterfully woven cinematic universe beginning back in 2008 with iron man we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to and it did not disappoint thanos is a complex villain with deeper and more interesting desires than just world domination the dilemmas all the characters face in this movie both the heroes and the villains are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat no other set of movies has beeen so involved so expanded and encompassed so many story lines characters and previous movies the sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline", "summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like epic spectacle and smash as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales\nthe summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with avengers infinity war and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the marvel cinematic universe\nwhen thanos josh brolin embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the infinity stones he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path when his pursuit leading him to earth bruce banner mark ruffalo and doctor strange benedict cumberbatch who enlist a reluctant tony stark robert downey jr to the cause just as the minions of thanos arrive\nwith the avengers fractured and scattered following the events of captain america civil war the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team this allows for a great entry by the guardians of the galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic you have a story with the guardians as well as one with many of the key avengers as well as others with characters old and new as such it is like a guardians avengers and marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect while the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing\nnaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye popping action sequence\nwhat really impressed me the most was that the russo brothers never let the fx of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other\nthere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any marvel film to date many fans had expressed disappointment with avengers age of ultron for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a marvel fan would want in a film\ni was also surprised by how well thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type i am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene\nbelieve the hype avengers infinity war is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be\n5 stars out of ", "i was amazed to see so many negative reviews so many people are impossible to please this movie was 2 1 2 hours long but i could have sat there another 2 1 2 hours and not noticed thoroughly entertaining and i love how the directors werent afraid to take chances ive read a lot of other user reviews that claim that theres no plot unless youre mentally handicapped or not paying attention because youre on your phone the entire movie the plot is pretty clear and decent in my opinion", "all the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls idiots or didnt are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for infinity war because of their fundamental lack of understanding its like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot its utterly ridiculousthere have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point all 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war infinity war is the end game movie there is nothing left to explain nothing left to discuss it is all out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence the infinity stones there have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and or the heroes that come together to fight thanos in this movie its like a long game of chess where thanos finally makes his move and its a huge oneso i beg of any of you who reads this dont listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot has no reason and is only fighting they arent worth listening to infinity wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death and the movie is done to near perfection the movie is glorious the cgi is fantastic the battles are awe inspiring and thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning he is truly the mad titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes anyone who doesnt think this clearly didnt see the same movie", "i absolutely loved this movie it was intense action packed and emotional also delivering comedy when needed but it was a relatively dark film all of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that theyre superheroes this is easily the best superhero movie ever made thanos is one of the best villains of the mcu as well as one of the best of cinematic history in general upon first viewing i hated him but found his character intriguing similar to emperor palpatine in the original and prequel trilogies of star wars the more times i rewatch it though i start to understand thanos point of view more and more the blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling even driving some people to say that thanos was right in all this i wouldnt go that far but i would say his character is misunderstood definitely a compelling villain in thanos the ending of the movie was insanely emotional but i love how they mainly set aside the original avengers team to take on thanos in the fourth avengers movie i for one cannot waitthat eerie thanos will return at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine it truly is the end game now and i cant wait to see the avengers rise up and likely defeat thanos in the next movie+every hero has their moment to shine much like the villain wants the movie achieves balance in this way\n+good comedic moments to balance again pun intended the dark tone of the film\n+emotional and heavy ending seeing earths mightiest fail is something devastating to watch\n+complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years\n+incredible performances\n+phenomenal original score \netc not much you can find thats wrong with this movie its literally the perfect movie marvel has been building up to for 10 years and those that claim it didnt have an ending as a negative i beg to differ just because the villain won doesnt mean it didnt have an ending my rating 10 1", "this movie was an underwhelming chaotic blend of several different movies im going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work ill start with the villainthanos as a whole is a pretty good villain he is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script the problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent guardians of the galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are but infinity war seems to forget that in the battle on titan iron man and about five others are able to hold thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off at this point thanos has four infinity stones sorry but there is no way they could restrain him at that point  infinity war also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction collectively they are called the black order or dark order and their names are never said so ill give them nicknames there is noseless the terriblewho is terrible avatar lady with horns also terrible rock dude basically korg but bigger with a goatee and guy with pointy axe the only people who understand who the heck these characters are are marvel comic fans the biggest problem with infinity war is the character developments and inconsistencies ill describe the worst casesstar lord when the first guardians of the galaxy came out star lord was a great character infinity war completely ruins him he turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot there are brief flashes of the old star lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise at one point during the battle on titan thanoss home planet iron man doctor strange and the guardians of the galaxy have thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet which makes no sense in the first place because at this point thanos has four feakin infinity stones as they are removing the glove from thanoss hand star lord finds out that thanos killed gamora earlier in the movie \nstar lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from mantiss mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy vision the development of vision is also really really bad in age of ultron he is strong enough to wield thors hammer but in infinity war he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot thor so in thor ragnarok it was established that thor is the god of thunder and doesnt need a hammer to be powerful then in infinity war they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll in fact he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon did the directors forget about what got established in ragnarok or did they just make thor weak because once again it fits the plot and marvel can get away with whatever the heck they wantscarlet witch wow her character was inconsistent one minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off thanos who has five infinity stones at this point for an extended period of time once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene hulk so apparently the hulk is now scared to come out ahh poor little guy this is a terrible plot twist and really doesnt make much sense another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters i was worried that it might be too many and it was as a result there were too many different subplots going on and they couldnt even have one final battle they had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of cgi filled action for the last forty five minutes of the movie now ill discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief descriptionnew york battle 2 10 this battle was absolutely terrible noseless the terrible comes in with the rock dude and tears up the city to take doctor strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling the action in alicia vikanders tomb raider was better than the action in this battlewakanda battle 8 10 this battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action the first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though it also gets annoying because its only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on titan or thor forging his hammer axe thingy overall though this battle was good and part of the reason that i give infinity war a 6 and not something much lowerbattle on titan 6 10 while there is some good action in this battle there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around thanos and how powerful he is overall i wasnt super impressedi also need to discuss thanoss plan for a second he wants to wipe out half of the universes population because the universe is overcrowded then he can finally rest did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing i definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth finally i am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes avengers 4 really predictable so at the end of the movie thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed somehow by random selection all the original avengers survive the odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing the characters that die are almost all new characters like black panther spiderman doctor strange etc several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything its just too predictableoverall infinity war was not a very good movie i do not understand the hype it was choppy inconsistent overcrowded and overall just not the great movie its cracked up to be i would not recommend going to the theater for this one i left feeling exhausted and tired of the mcu", "i went and looked and i want to express my thoughtsi went to this film with very high expectations with a sense of something i went to him twice the first time myself and the second with the family and i was even surprised that my mother sister and dad who do not understand this movie at all brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotionseach frame each scene does not let you get bored from the marvel logo and to the stage after the credits favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath in comparison with the war of infinity even the confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandboxuuuu and the villain the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy he is not just a bot at once without motivation no its just the opposite i liked thanos so much that you do not want to and he began to impress me in terms of his convictions i had it only once with joker heath ledger he has feelings he makes choices hes alivetense scenes are beautiful in one moment i still let off a meager male tear and this happens to me very very rarely what about the humor the jokes are correct for me and they do not bother you like thor ragnarok although in the beginning they look a little tight well the action it is very high quality and in comparison with the black panther is generally idealand of course the film can not be without punctures the lack of predictability of some story lines and a couple of moments that were very predictable but they are fade against the background of all this scaleyes you will not find anything in this film about something something but what what what steep humor thanks to marvel and of course the rousseau brothers the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that ive been waiting for for 3 yearsout of 10 i give the war of infinity 9", "i dont mean to be negative here but avengers infinity wars 89 on imdb is entirely undeserved marvel superfan or not this movie has nothing on films like the dark night la la land pulp fiction or inception all films which it either outranks based on its 89 rating or comes close to i get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film and its awesome to see our favorite marvel characters come together the guardians of the galaxy thor spiderman captain america black panther etc but we shouldnt let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that avengers infinity war is an overly long movie that relies on cheap unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isnt particularly well written or edited i commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories but the movie just felt too long its fight scene after fight scene and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny the film isnt really original and its only redeeming factor is that its full of characters we all know and love its funny to see thor poke fun at the guardians of the galaxy and to see iron man and spiderman interact with doctor strange but when we look at the film objectively its really just a standard superhero film with more superheroes than normal that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion no matter how much we love marvel we all know that theres no way any of the characters who died are actually going to die the filmmakers expect us to believe that black panther who just made marvel over one billion dollars spiderman and the guardians of the galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises i hate to say it but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value and its cheap from a technical perspective the fight scenes are directed well but thats about it the editing isnt particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes i feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better overall avengers infinity war could have been amazing but its too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype this film is not deserving of its 89 rating on imdb i think that captain america civil war was a *much* better movie65 out of 10", "engrossing epic emotional those are the three es that define this movie the latest instalment of the marvel cinematic universe franchise is at its very best culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre \nso lets start with anthony and joe russo the geniuses that made this beast of a movie after announcing that they will be directing the next two avengers movies marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest avengers movie yet yes it was very dark with more of a serious tone more than winter soldier and civil war previous marvel movies directed by the russo bothers combined but they also had what the other avengers movies had as well the humour and it was not at all tasteless nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie this is by far the russo brothers best work among the marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to its highest praise to christopher markus and stephen mcfeely for writing the amazing script they also wrote the scripts of captain america the avengers winter soldier age of ultron and civil war also known to be the best marvel movies \nnow the characters and story practically everyone that youve seen in the previous marvel movies that arent dead are in this movie everyone had the chance to shine even if its the smallest way possible there were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline makes you jump scream gasp or cry \nand of course the one and only thanos the villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers josh brolin officially portrays the best villain in the mcu completely pissing on marvels villain problem he brings all out on the table with everything hes got not only will you hate thanos by the end of the movie but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds they brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a marvel villain they made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable the motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie making the movie all about him \ni cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then i would be spoiling all i have to say is that whether youre a marvel fan or not and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies go and watch it it will not be a waste of your time or money digest this to prepare for whats to come i may be bias once again but i just have to i have to rate this movie 10 10 if i dont i would be betraying myself", "well well welli was so ready to tear this down   19th mcu film too many stars bloated cgi first of a two parter and so on and so onyet this is so much fun pure popcornnow in the dictionary under popcorn film is just the poster for this film somehow the russo brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun they are helped immensely by two things the premise is so pure mcguffin that you just watch thanos look for infinity stones which gives a primal momentum and that the films stars characters are looking to move on   that means actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying eitherthe dc people must be kicking themselves the lightness and comedic touches are brilliant you are laughing out loud comedy level but at totally organic character humour it means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running timethe other big surprise is thanos himself normally i hate cgi characters but somehow they have made thanos and josh brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc this is one of the better mcu villains and i never thought i would write thatthe stakes are real the charisma levels are amazing it is like oceans 28 and i cant wait for the sequelthat says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced", "oh my god what an incredible film ive never done a review of a movie before ive only done tv shows so bare with me im gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two but to start offwow this film could be the best marvel movie ever but i will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that it absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since iron man 1 how far weve come in a quick 10 years is remarkable the thanos character absolutely hit the mark he was menacing intimidating vicious and so much more props to the actor who played him thanos plan succeeds for the time being and we get a whole lot of death because of it in this movie there was death and death the former refers to characters such as loki vision and gamora we saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind for this movie not to lose credibility these characters in my opinion must remain dead now death refers to what we saw at the end thanos with all infinity stones clicked his fingers and half of humanity including half of the avengers important to note that all the original avengers are still alive dissolved into dust giving the impression of death i expect these characters to come back at some point during the next avengers film most likely due to the originals saving them my final theory regards doctor strange on the ship with stark and spidey strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over stark and spideys lives however in the end we see strange give up the stone to thanos on the condition stark stay alive my prediction is that when strange saw all the possible futures the only future in which they win must heavily rely on tony stark which makes sense tony started it all so he should finish it incredible film cant wait for the next one to see how it all resolves 98 1", "this movie has made me feel things that i havent about a movie in a very long time if you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of everything is gonna be alright because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is the emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on dont get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more im definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next avengers movie", "spoiler alert\ni am a marvel chick i totally dig the whole marvel verse and wave my fangirl flag proudly i was looking forward to this movie so muchthen something happened i went to see it today i did not read any of the reviews before i went i never do i always view a film without input from folk that usually dont know what i like so there i was popcorn and coke in hand two rows back from the screen cause im into total immersion okay in my reclining seat ten minutes in and i know were in trouble its not the fact that two of my favorite characters didnt survive the opening credits this is infinity war right people are gonna die its just seemed so pointless loki dies but thor survives how is that fair hemdall dies saving hulk of all people not that im hatin on hulkbut come on hemdall you have sworn an oath to the thone of asgard and you dont save either of the princes really i know hulk is refusing to come out after thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but stillthe movie goes rapidly downhill from here thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film we bounce all over the world and off it to keep thanos away from the infinity stones who decided that two of the most important stones be hidden on earth not a good idea our merry band of marvel heroes needs to take a page out of the star trek verse the needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one this could have saved so many lives loki gives thanos the tesseract to save thor thanos tried to kill them all anyway actually succeeds in killing both loki hemdall and all of the asgardians thanos sacrifices gamora the daughter he loves thanos has a really weird idea of what love entailsbut whatever he does this so he can gain access to the soul stone dr strange gives thanos the time stone to save tony stark tony stark wasnt his expiration date up like a couple years ago  this gives thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants which he does after scarlett witch kills vision her lover to destroy the mind stone he just turns back time rips the stone out of visions head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it so scarlett witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothingthis could have been a good movie maybe even a great one but its not its a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every marvel movie over the past 10 years there are a few notable omissions most of the gang is on deck but theyre so ineffective they rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial romantic themes i get that pepper and tony are an item we knew this already i get that black widow and bruce are an item we knew this two movies ago same with gamora and peter scarlett witch and vision and on and on and on this is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesnt the fight sequence in wakanda and on thanos home planet were so predictable such a waste of excellent cgi and actorsthe only surprise in the movie is who survives thor tony stark and steve rogers survive i know this is to set up the next part of the infinity war set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year the russo boys need to step up their game this disappointment does not bode well for the new film guys sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing just fyi you just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah blah blah been there done that i really wanted to love this movie i really really did but i left the theater feeling used and not in a good way i felt like marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven because you know its eleven which is one more than ten righti rated the movie a 4 because i wanted it to be good it just wasnt", "in order to explain current mass appeal i have to quote senator gracchus in gladiator rome is the mob conjure magic for them and theyll be distractedand thats what this is conjured magic meant to distract the masses and by gosh thats what its done no real plot overlapping storylines that go nowhere computer animated trash and thats the point give the masses what they want come up with the formula spend $350 to develop and presto $2b in receipts from the mob who cant distinguish between art and trash wash rinse repeat", "im probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time marvel fans will probably disagree with me there is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacularhowever for me there were too many obvious special effects too many leading characters and far far far too much action it just keeps coming at you relentlessly at the same time theres not enough real story and characterisation not enough time to take in whats going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many marvel films ive seen before i just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle when it finally did end i felt cheated of the time", "just wow  the russo nailed it hand down from me they did it again part by part is interesting to watch  some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad thanos is the best villain ive ever seen he not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones one of the best part of it the team up guardian & avengers just amazing full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together for 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in avengers 4 really hype about itreally worth watching it  if u non marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch  really enjoy it  of course every good movie always have some issue with it but just minor issue can close eye and let it go going to watch it again soon  love from malaysia", "infinity war is a good super hero movie but i thought thor ragnarok and black panther were bettermarvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies\n1 if a battle between the hulk and thor in ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat im pretty sure hulk vs thanos in a spaceship would last one punch2 star lord is just a dude he does not catch and hold spider man3 if tony stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in iron man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in waconda im sure war machine would have access to activate them4 if scarlet witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near wakonda why do 2 dudes in scotland give her a hard time5 steve rogers isnt invulnerable when swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth hes apparently unharmed after thors hammer clears the baddies away they had time to rip steve up but didntdont take the easy way out when writing the story a lot of it was good but some of it was not writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief\n1 when an elaborate plan pins thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he cant destroy the universe nobody would stop to talk to thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe at the very least you shut up and help remove the gauntlet so thanos cant destroy the universe2 gamora really thinks thanos doesnt love her all that time she was talking about thanos not loving anyone made no sense i kept thinking gamora youre being really stupid everybody knows whats going to happen maybe you should try running or anything3 when thor arrives at wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump smash banner even feels he has time to stop open his helmet to say you guys are so screwed now but when all the heroes go to protect vision from thanos thor arrives after thanos gets the last stonei know im picking its because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and id rather not have anymore x men the last stand or fantastic four 2015", "the most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word i have to say that infinity war was brilliant on each scale whether be its story visual effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the marvel characters every marvel fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie", "in the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops the action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action this could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous the only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is thanos and he is an interesting figure and i fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books but one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise and i do not in any way blame them for this but when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal i really cant bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer for the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue \n \nthe day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day i will respect marvel after watching this movie i feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure peter quill is just like they did with danny rand in the defenders", "*** warning mild spoilers ahead *** ok what sticks out about this movie nothing much \nthe acting is lackluster no character has a character arc   understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time the whole movie is basically one endless 3 hour brawl with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from star wars lord of the rings some of the brawls are so over the top that they are ludicrous even by comicbook standards example when you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land the motivation of the villain makes no sense after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough given that its hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full cgi villain makes it even less likely some of gamoras mood swings in the matter where were supposed to emote with him or her make even less sensespeaking of cgi its on a level weve come to expect with some weird exceptions eg in one instance we see bruce banners head in the open cockpit of the hulkbuster armor while hes standing around in the background   and it looks like someone just copied it in with ms paint seriously not even photoshop quality but ms paintthe humor is relegated to one liners and most dont land the serious one liners are predictable and pithy \nthe music score is effective if somewhat over the top pathos heavy but thats not unusual for us films so it one of those things weve come to expect to have to endurethe overwhelming feeling is that this movie was designed by comittee the boardroom idea seems to have been take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non stop \nproblem is it doesnt work that way gems in movies are that because they are rare taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeterafter coming back i rewatched the first avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me but no it is a way way way superior film in every respect", "avengers infinity war 2018 is something new with the ending that the antagonist defeats all protagonists and destroys its fictional universe and what we saw was the shooting game of 159 minutes \n the avengers age of ultron 2015s box office record was 133061397 hkd this is ranked as top #2 the avengers 2012 was 96705670 hkd ranked #7 moreover avengers infinity war 2018 has been ranked #10 box office mega hit blockbuster 86134777 hkd in hong kong at the present since its release in the end of april \n american comic characters and its model figures comic books and souvenirs flooded the every town malls and markets around hong kong even though you cant tell their identities you are quite familiar with their imaginaries marketers who handling american comic related products succeeded in mass marketing operations in this market \n the story line is simple enough that antagonist thanos defeats iron man hulk captain america doctor strange spider man and other sub characters who embody this american comic justice league to put an end to their universe and it is racially white heroes world i can only see fat chinese sub character with oriental magic\n as the result what we can only see is 159 mins of shooting game and at the end we see there is nothing more it reminded me of edgar allan poes the raven\nat the end what i can say for this film is only this and nothing more like edgar allan poes the raven\n0 out of nothing", "8 minutes of original banality repeated for well over two hours", "i just cant comprehend most of the main characters dying at the end of this film such a let down i grew up with most of these characters most of these were my super heroes as a childmarvel and whoever made the film let our dreams die in this huge let down of a movie part two had better be out of this worl", "suffering hype fatigue over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release it takes away from viewing the movie in the end its just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age the first avengers was original but now what hollywood movie makers due best take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs sorry about raining on your hollywood comic book heroes block borer but the only hero i can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels theyve become boring and predictable recycles i spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie seems hollywood is addicted to cgi for making movies that shouldnt be made if they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up no story plot or actors acting just things blowing up"], "sentiment":
