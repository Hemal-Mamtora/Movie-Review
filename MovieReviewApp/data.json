{"movie": [{"movie_name": "dangal", "review": ["mahavir singh phogat teaches his two daughters to be international wrestling players of india this is a simple and impressive story and they finally defeat uk on the wrestling match  i think this is indias yip man this kind of nationalism is healthy and is beneficial to all audiences without background considerations the film length is also accurate growing courses of protagonists need 160 minutes and emotional responses to their tragic mistakes are well described by the talented actors in detail audiences can fully engage in this film  a lot of asian audiences have bias against indian films that their films are just dances and songs for two hours or more however there is the perfect construction of story with minimalist use of songs and musics  this quality is higher than any japanese films of today indian filmmakers should keep this high quality of film content it is competitive to hollywood films at the end of the film it is full of enlightenment the most important thing in life is not thing but it is a human relationship with emotion if you are true to your families goodness and emotion youll find the best solution of your problem even though you fail in this way your family relationship will only be enhanced as the result of your effort and sincereness this what this film tells you  thank you", "dangal is a masterpiece a terrific film that stays in your heart and remains etched in your memory much after the screening has concluded a brilliant film that restores your faith in hindi cinema actually it wont be erroneous to state that dangal is the finest film to come out of the hindi film industry in a long long time and mark my words it will be remembered as a classic in times to come it blends drama emotions sportsmanship and patriotism extraordinarily\u0085 the icing on the cake being aamir khans towering act this rich in merits film has a major advantage too    the holidays ahead christmas and new year    which will ensure a glorious run at the ticket counters a must must watch", "i saw this with my family in a theatre awesome experience aamirs acting effort n most importantly his passion is what makes his cinema so damn unique first thing dangal has going for it is aamir khan aamir khan gave arguably the best performance of his career playing phogat he is the best actor in bollywood period he shocked me by his transformation i myself being a gym trainer knows the effort which goes in such kinda transformation without aamir i dont think this movie could have achieved what it has the child actors were good too the music was good the direction by tiwari was the best of 2016 this movie was never boring and full credit shud go to the director the cinematography gave you a feeling as if what you are watching is real overall you dont have to like wrestling or know wrestling to appreciate this movie its a wonderful movie the movie is written very well superb screenplay n crispy editing", "aamir khan shines in the role of mahavir singh phogat he is so outstanding in his performance that this could be considered as one of his best works ever the opening scene of the film is just a glimpse of phogats passion for the sport \u2013 wrestling the first half of dangal works exactly like a skilled wrestler \u2013 invariably sure of its moves the films second half is all about victory mahavirs transformation from the once upset father of a baby girl to the most triumphant one to geetas string of losses before she finally wins a gold during common wealth games to desi akhara being replaced by wrestling mat \u2013 every moment works in contrast to what you had watched earlier but not even once does the film loses its focusa word here about mukesh chhabras casting he has done a tremendous job of the casting nitesh tiwaris direction is amazingly terrific amitabhbhattacharyas lyrics are great pritams music is in terrific sync with the mood of the drama dangal dangal is a very inspiring song and will soon become a rage dhaakad and haanikarak are also very well tuned the gilehariyaan song has terrific charm of a different kind amitabh bhattacharyas lyrics are great the song writer may pick up some awards for his lyrics bosco  caesars choreography is very real pritams background music deserves distinction marks the actors who play the young geeta and babita zaira wasim suhani bhatnagar do a competent job of maintaining the audiences attention and both shaikh and malhotra carry it forward especially when they spend a lot of the second half on the mat learning how to lose and above all to win since it encapsulates the historic win of the phogats who bought india glory so it is bound to inspire women dialogues are absolute gems without being overtly long they are so effective that they invariably touch the heart before reaching the ears on the whole\u00a0dangal\u00a0is not just a movie it is an experience to be cherished the film is destined to be one of the biggest blockbusters of indian cinemaas it content oriented so the movie is both for the single screens as well as for the multiplexes and people of all age can watchso this movie is a must

start first of aamir sir has done it again he really has a good taste in selecting movies not only the acting even the fighting scenes were quite real to me & reel geeta and babita were just too awesome there is certain moments where youre gonna laugh out loud get anger get emotional and obviously feel proud the most thats what the movie brings out of itself i hope this movie brings joy to all family and a chance to look at all daughters of theirs potentialshould you go for it hell yessongs are smartly enough and pretty amazingps i wished the movie to be a bit longer", "director mr nitesh tiwari work is so brilliant that after few minutes you just forget that you are watching film you simply start witnessing the journey of phogats family makers are so confident that they have even given credit for story idea to divya rao which reflects their honesty she is not in writing team but gets her due credit there are four writers director himself piyush gupta shreyas jain and nikhil mehrotra and their work is fantastic screenplay is seamless and very balanced with much needed freshness film starts with glimpse of mahavir singh phogats passion for wrestling while watching and challenging another district level arrogant winner while commentary comes over on them which is fresh when that person gets defeated he says tumne district level pehlawan ko haraya hai then mahavir singh replies  tension mat le tum national level champion se hare ho words may be a bit different but meaning was same which gives strong idea that what level of dialogues you are going to listen and they have maintained the graph dialogues just nourish your senses inducing correct emotions a simple scene where protagonist massages feet of his sleeping daughter clearly reflects that he is just not a ruthless coach but a caring father too girls curse their father in front of their friend who is getting married then that girl emotional words about her feeling towards their caring father is very cute emotional and enough to make girls realize that what they are taking for granted best part of this film is its continues ascending graph in every aspect first half is cute funny with subtle dose of emotions second half takes this graph to the horizon full of emotions either it is of defeat victory or relations another major plus point is the way they have shown wrestling i dint know a bit of it but i enjoyed all wrestling matches like it was my favorite game and that is major chunk of film hats off to the team behind wresting choreography though you have basic idea of film happenings but still they kept you engrossed by presentation climax comes with a very strong message that one can train you but only you have to implement the techniques which makes you true winner and enriches self confident performance makes you thunderstruck words can not justify or compliment amir khans performance as mahavir singh phogat zaira waseem as younger geeta is brilliant she is so good that when fatima sana sheikh takes over as grown up geeta you miss younger one but soon fatima proves that she has taken the graph far ahead same happens with younger babita played by suhani bhatnagar and grown up by sanya malhotra skashi tanwar as wife of mahavir singh is very good girish kulkarni  who had played coach is superb you do hate his character but love his performance actor who played younger cousin of geeta and even grown up one both actors are cute and endearing kudos to casting director mukesh chhabra and team music by pritam and lyrics by amitabh bhattacharya are integral part of this film without any formulated track you just enjoy every song and your eyes get mois in one too", "just came home after watching the premier show it really is a masterpiece a compelling narrative based on a true story add stellar acting performances and humor pour in cinematography location songs & meaningful lyrics voila everything amazingly fits together in a single string truly clean entertainment in all sense of the word worth watching with family a good movie should entertain a great movie must connect and connect it did i could almost feel as if i were there throughout the plot development is deep and engaging did i mention the child actors especially the one portraying geeta outstanding performance by all in a nutshell my time & resources spent were fully worth and aamir khan boy he never disappoints =", "excellent movie stellar performance by aamir khan movie of the year the girls   kids and the grown ups portrayed their role very well special mention should be given to nitesh tiwari   the director music by pritam is good the cinematography is nice the story telling is superb overall very nice movie watch this movie for aamir khan hands down to aamir his role as mahavir singh phogat will be marked as one of his best this film will come as one of the best sports films based on the life of coach after chak de and iqbal i strongly recommend this film wish other actors think like how aamir khan thinks he is brilliant actor that makes him special and perfectionist my rating 10 10", "story 9 10 a very true inspiring story of former wrestler champion mahavir singh phogat whose dream is to win a gold medal for india in wrestling but he fails to achieve that then he avow that his son will do it however he got disappointed when his wife gives birth to four daughtersmusic 9 10 amazing very touching background greatly synced title track will give you goosebumpsdirection 9 10 nitesh tiwari achieved what he wanted got a new name one of the best directors of bollywoodacting aamir khan 10 10 this time as a father he will amaze you in every scene his acting skills are deeply great whenever i watch aamirs movies i feel his acting he loves acting and entertaining the world since he came to the film industryfatima sana shaikh 9 10 sometimes i still watch chachi 420 because i love kamal hassan and fatima sana shaikh was the little girl in chachi 420 seriously i have seen her after chachi 420 and after dangal she will go so faraamir khan and the two lead actress are the best cast roles in a long time but overall cast done an amazing jobdangal is humorous and inspirational journey", "mahavir singh phogat is a former champion wrestler he is married to shobha kaur phogats dream is to win a gold medal for india in wrestling he is unable to do this he promises that his son will do what he couldnt do however although he loves them dearly phogat is disappointed when shobha gives birth to four daughters he does not believe girls can wrestle well however when two of his daughters geeta and babita come home after beating up two boys phogat realises how wrong he has been and begins to train his daughters in wrestling the film is the story of how phogat trained his daughters to become professional wrestlers", "my dangal review thoughtsin the moments of tension i believe everyone exhibits their own unique body language to deal with nervousness and anxiousness mine involves folding hands christian style i am worried that i folded my hands for so long during the film that had i done the same in a temple i would have been some shah rukh khan myself yes  the film is that excellent in its portrayal of the sport that it makes you grudge every time a player lands back first on the mat we are so used to applauding action set pieces in other films that it will be criminal if the action choreography for dangal goes unappreciated this is the best and most realistic we have ever donethe whole cast is so great that i cant do anything but wonder why we need the glam actresses for each and every big filmwhy not some sakshi talwar the new faces do wonders when it comes to making the illusion of cinema feel true and when aamir the superstar sheds former self to becomes some chachajaan it adds to the illusion instead of taking the magic away i am bound to praise aamir but that guy has lost that element of surprise to make you go wow he is just aamir being aamir in yet another film thatll be brought in his already long good list this is what happens when you submit yourself to the script and director <= full marksmost sports film are marred by clich\u00e9s its impossible to evade the conventional trappings of the genre dangal has its fair share of those but the biggest thing is that it knows when to stop and thats what makes it a stadium like live experience my adrenaline rush was high and it made me very nostalgic as i got reminded of cwg delhi days when i was 24*7 glued to dd sports at this point i feel my review is deviating from its path so i will put breaks by making a concluding statementthis is aamirs chak de india i am speaking this both figuratively and literally    but who in the right mind would mind another one of those", "i got the privilege to watch this film earlier than the india release as i happen to live in north america thank you disney now what to say about dangal its not a typical bollywood film yet it is easily the best bollywood film ever even in terms of every so called bollywood masala trick the incredible storytelling based on true events every small detailing amazing cast the message it had without being preachy or pretentious but still powerful there was not one single boring moment in the movie well probably one if you are too pickythough it is nearly three hours kudos to the director and what to say about aamir khan though he did not have any dramatic moment in the movie those belong to the girls who were fabulous by the way he is not the charming usual boy next door sexy or cheeky personthe traits which are generally associated with aamir khan rather he is a brute has a tummy for the majority length of the movie yet you will not be able to keep him off your mind even after the movie ends and easily the best aamir khan performance ever and yes i have seen every aamir khan film each a million time", "this movie proves that india is not yet ready for an honest biopic film although the film excelled in every other aspects such as acting cinematography special effects music especially music but it couldnt capture the real aspect of the story of the wrestlers daughter and her sisters we never get to know her enthusiasm towards wrestling was it her relationship with her father who imposed his dream of winning a gold on her or her duty towards her nation to win it or was it her own desire to never give up or lose to a competitive opposition to satisfy her own egothis film was heavily clich\u00e9d just for the purpose of entertaining the masses and clearly may have aggravated many characters who are related to this story too much hype may have given this movie the attention that it pursued and why not this is business after allmuch disappointed with the makers of the film for adulterating such an awesome script which may have had made everybody proud current imdb score 92 with over 13k users where have we gone wrongfinal verdict its a good watch but one wouldnt rate this movie 9 10 unless he she had any personal attachment towards the film it has good social message dialogues an 8 would be too generous hence i would rate it 6 or 7 out of 10", "its conceivable that a wrestling movie might have you on the edge of your seat but whod have thought it would bring tears to your eyes dangal does both in large doses right from the opening scenes through to the awesome climax this is one movie that will keep you glued to the screen i cant remember the last 3 hour movie nearly where absolutely nobody took a toilet break apart from in the intermissioneverything about the movie is superb from the cinematography through to the script writing the movie is superbly directed and there are so many stellar acting performances that it would be unfair to single anyone outone thing about sports movies is that the action can often seem staged but the fight sequences in this movie are superbly done and brilliantly filmedeveryone knows an ak movie is going to be great and this definitely doesnt disappointa must watch", "nitesh tiwari amir khan and the team has put an extra ordinary effort to make such an intelligent blend of inspiration emotions and humor that standing ovation at the end is irresistible dangal has a very unfamiliar high level of detail which is too good for bollywood high detailing make actors live the character which doesnt go unnoticed and dangal proves this point each actor wasnt just playing the character they were truly living it it was the phogat family viewers saw on screen instead of the actors that makes dangal stand out acting is brilliant by both the lead and supporting actors mr perfectionist was great like always no words to describe his level of commitment special mentions are the debutantes fatima sana shaikh sanya malhotra and zaira waseem all the wrestling scenes are perfect and viewers cant mistake them for actors the way these girls portrayed the characters of the wrestlers geeta and babita is commendable and worthy of every award story was based on a true story and the director stuck to it with some slight additions to make the movie more emotional and enjoyable which is good for bollywood audience but as a critic i must say there was a little bit of over dramatization in the end also i want to mention that ak and nitesh didnt include any usual romantic crap and dance sequences which must be appreciated casting could have been better fatima is too cute for geetas character and this matters a lot while making a biography but she minimized this shortcoming by her flawless performance movie is 2hr40mins long but its well crafted so its enjoyable ____________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ its a must watch movie and amir khan keeps on setting standards for other producers of bollywood which makes us hope for a better future of movies in india", "aamir khan is back after pk as a wrestler who wants his daughter to win the gold for the nation it is a biopic of mahavir phogat and believe me its a must watch biopic to get inspiration to achieve something you have to let go the rest of the thingsa simple story with great performances make this film a worthy watch aamir khan is as usual fantastic but the girls are true heroes of this film fatimah who plays geeta is a sure shot winner she looks exactly as per her character and delivers great impact as a wrestler younger girls of geeta and babita are also very fine sakshi has a small role but she plays it safely aparshakti khurana is doing a voice over here and plays a role of the girls cousin brother he is funny and entertains the audiences for sure girish kulkarni is also there who delivered a classy performance in ugly so the star cast and their performances are the biggest point of dangaldirection and writing by nitesh tiwari are worthy enough for viewers as they dont get bored in any situation except one after interval song that is like something slow paced everyone has to applause him as he gives justice to phogats family and doesnt add any extra material which we often see in bollywood movies he has delivered the frame as it is so the middle class viewer can easily be able to connect with the film what i like the most in the film apart from the performances is music pritam has given it with the lyrics of amitabh bhatacharya both were amazing in ae dil hai mushkil this time also they are killing the stereotypes i loved all the songs im downloading it hanikarak bapu and dhakad are pitch perfect they have some english words as well as some pure hindi words in them which make them enjoyable but the best song is by far the title track in the voice of daler mehndi full marks to the music departmentyes it is very emotional film those who get the connection easily with films may cry during some scenes even im one of them too it is better than sultan because its a pure wrestling movie with a family background sultan was like a love story with a background of wrestling till interval and then box fighting post interval i wish dangal may cross the record of sultan at box officeon the whole just go and enjoy the perfect film with your entire family as many time as you can btw i will go for the second time for sure so 2016 has ended with a perfect film jai hind", "dangal 9 10 is the kind of film for which the 70mm medium exists it has universal appeal is technically brilliant and more than anything else it is a film that skillfully balances popular sentiments and realism it is going to reach tens of millions of people without having compromised the quality of storytellingan extraordinary story of some extraordinary people who not only conquered their fears but also a society which had the negativity to kill their dreams even before they were bornif chak de was a fine example of exemplary editing in a sports film and pan singh tomar was an exceptional sports film with great depth and realism dangal would forever be remembered as one of the best indian sports film for the sheer reach it will have wrestling is a fast paced technical sport to make the whole thing look as authentic as it has looked in the film it would have required some meticulous planning and extensive training and they have done it really wellthe fact that you feel the frustration that mahavir singh phogat feels in the final scene and you along with the whole audience begins to clap after each of geetas winning bout as if there was a live game at display shows how supremely engaging the film is one negative though not significant enough to harm the film is that it has over dramatazied the narrative at the cost of slight misrepresentation of the factsonly if the majority of indian film makers could realize that it is not impossible to make good cinema with popular appeal we would start getting more than just a couple of hindi films every year worth watching now is a good time to list top films from india in the sports drama genre 1paan singh tomar

all mr khans most emotional film and as always a perfectionist as everto end a great step to lightened the darker side of the societ", "dangal   its such a good thing that both pink and dangal  two top movies of this year are women centric its such an improvement for bollywood which doesnt make movies on women because such movies doesnt make money  which is a wrong fact  pink made almost 300% profit you just need to make a good movie and it will make you money and by saying women centric m serious the character of mahavir phogat is not the real hero of the movie  rather its his daughter geeta phogat who is in the center of the movie for understanding what mahavir phogat has achieved in his life  we must know the fact that hariyana is one of the worst state in india for girls a very low sex ratio and a very low literacy rate for women and in such scenario what mahavir phogat has achieved is tremendous that said  one thing is clear that we cant expect anything out of the box which we always get from amirs movies like 3 idiot  pk and talaash  because its a biopic  so they have to show what actually happened  which is not exactly bad things  in fact what this movie shows is an out of the box real life story first i would like to mention two things which i dont liked 1st   the way the wrestling coach of national sports academy has been shown as one sided villain also who is kind of incapable to train  was wrong 2nd   there was an unnecessary twist in the end which seems unconvincing apart from these two things  everything else is either good or great in the movie the movie tackle through different themes sometimes it tackles them one by one  and sometimes simultaneously but the good thing is that it tackles them convincingly for example when we see mahavir training his daughters rigorously  there comes a thought that what kind of dad he is he just stole the childhood of her daughters to fulfill his own dreams but after some scenes on the wedding of mahavirs daughters friend both the daughters complaining about mahavir her friend who is getting married reply that she hoped that she would had get such father as mahavir who thinks about their daughters and wants them to achieve something and not like his own father who force her to marry at the age of just 14 to an unknown person that particular scene convince the audience that what mahavir is doing is not wrong as compared to the society where they are living another theme which movie showed very convincingly was how free a girl feel when she goes out of his family for the first time almost 1 hour of the movie contains wrestling matches and those matches were done extremely well on technical level  and hook you like you were watching a real match i mean as compared to this the matches show in sultan were just nothing among the performances zaira wasim also the lead actor of amirs next secret superstar playing young geeta was delight to watch the scene where she request her father to not cut her hair and she will do anything he wants was heartbreaking and she does her fighting scenes very well considering the fact that the director in an interview has mentioned that zaira was actually the weakest among all the four girls before they start their training but when it comes to fight scenes  fatima sana sheik as the older geeta was best she fights like a real fighter and her hard work is visible on the screen on her dramatic acting front she was awesome too both the actresses who played young and old babita were good too  but got less screen time as compared to geetas character aparshakti khuranabrother of ayushman khurana as the nephew of mahavir has an impeccable timing of comedy  and surly will make you laugh many time but for amir khan  what to say  he blends so nicely  that he became mahavir  and the actor amir is nowhere visible anywhere he just makes me wonder why cant other actors yes pointing at srk and sallu stop showing their persona and blend into characters in their movies  around the whole movie there were so many whistle blowing happening  that i was not able to here the dialogues many times but just before climax  the national anthem runs in common wealth games after geeta phogat won her gold medali hope thats not a spoiler and the whole theater stands in respect of national anthem you just cant help and get overwhelmed 94 10 by anup apu kuma", "its a movie decked up with the classic acting of the veterans and the novices and bore the testimony of the unorthodox approach to bring to light the dream of mahavir phogat the fire of dangal ignited in the hearts of the sisters which paved the path of demolition of gender discrimination the film portrays the affectionate bonding of a father and a daughter and emotional rendition escalates barriers when the elder sister has kept the very words of her fathers dream in fact it is beautifully carved that our ignorance towards our family elders hinders our progress the film has been peppered with humour every now and then and it has added extra spice to the viewers", "honestly i was a bit determinant after watching sultan thinking that this film could be a remake but honestly after watching this movie it was a lot different this movie just melted my heart with the fantastic writing direction performances and editing nitesh tiwari brought 2 average films which were bhoothnath returns and chillar party but for this film he deserves a bow for the amount of hard work he managed to put for this filmthe performances in the movie were absolutely phenomenal aamir khan is back to becoming nuanced and self confident khan we always admired his fat to fit video really created a lot of inspiration for me and my friends and that increased our eager level in watching this movie sakshi tanwar is a pretty decent actress her role was absolutely strong and withheld but her dialogues in certain places were quite awkward and almost out of placethe girls who played geeta and babita just kept me to the edge of my seat what amazement these girls did and how they used their empowerment to pull of a male sport with such easethe screenplay and direction was something i really loved just like how haryana was shot and how the wrestling scenes were shotafter ae dil hai mushkil i managed to enjoy priams music but the songs in dangal were average and i wouldnt consider them at loop listening soundtracks not many songs really stand out as suchhonestly i enjoyed this movie much more than sultan based on its true story and fantastic direction overall this movie is a masterpiece with beautiful direction performances and acting this motion picture really touched my heart leave your house and grab your tickets this is definitely a cinema watching moviein any society it is very important to understand the meaning of women rights no matter how boyish something could be women are considered human beings girls have the right to do anything ranging from being a police officer to a taxi driver these are typical jobs that mostly men pull off but women can also pull these jobs off but much quicker try to understand that men and women are the same professional wise", "amir khan a person always amazes everyonerecently he is working for movies with a good moral lesson and a worthy basethat kind of movie is a movie dangal is a good example it has a classic taste and digestible fun which peels off the people eyes it is a true story full of suspense and when youre watching a fight you feel like you are wrestling in between this kind of quality is difficult to be produced and amir is good at it the reason for giving 9 stars is because of its ending i think it should be made better by showing scene like he is putting that medal at the wall of honor anyways keep it up i was expecting this a thing from you love you ", "i am aware that many people would not like to read my review i have no doubt that the movie viewing experience with its emotional pot boiler roller coaster ride engages and is a good one better than the indian regional and vernacular soap opera dished out on indian television that is why i am giving 7 out of 10 ratingbut if a sensitive person looks beyond the cosmetics of movie dazzles \u2013 you will find someone is selling a regressive message through this film kodus to dangal team for achieving such a feat here is my takewhen the first poster of the movie was released i did not like it even though being a wrestler why four girls should look like boys was the first question i raisednow after reading so much appreciation and reviews of the movie i say this\u0095 this is another patriarchal portrayal of regressive india \u0095 a father forces his dreams on children one should never do \u0095 children should be kept free to develop and grow as they want \u0095 this is again patriarchy dominance on the feminine gender and forcing it with the power of parenting to subjugate the flourishing of womens gender \u0095 for sure the flourishing of womens gender is not in imitating men and or boys and becoming fighters wrestlers and looking masculine this is degrading the pride dignity and respect of being a woman \u0095 to use a true success story of a single case and successfully use it as propaganda for womens emancipation is sickening to say the least the negative fallout of this movie could be \u0095 irrespective of boys or girls many parents will force their children and more so to girls to do what they failed to achieve in life make their children do things that they as parents have dreamed sick mentality \u0095 many girls may start behaving like boys   wearing boys dress cutting hair like boys fighting like boys etc etc not at all in the spirit of humanism \u0095 father in the movie saying that my girls are no less than boys such comparisons are not needed in todays evolved society this is a phrase of sixties india it is similar to always call a girl tom boy and demean and insult her sexuality such comparisons just distort the femininity of girls and women who mis understand such statements as being treated like boys rather than girls \u0095 addressing girls as a male gender and treating one like that   the society like india   parents may do that to destroy the little bit of remaining self esteem that girls and women   have on their given gender and sexuality \u0095 i also am bothered   as i always tell everyone about it is man   in capitals that drive the so called womens emancipation and empowerment agenda   it is so disturbing to see this the four writers of the movie are men the director of the movie is wearing mens glasses the so called super star gender sensitive actor amir khan is too wearing a mans hat\u0095 in propaganda of spreading regressive message through this film the team too is of men   the director writer producer and lead actor   all men   who drive to influence the society in a way that may create a distorted image of what is meant by women empowerment \u0095 in real life on which the movie is based the father of the wrestling girls drives their lives such case studies should have been presented more sensitively by showing \u2013 such things need not be done \u2013 even though in the end it brings laurels for the country though i agree the medium of cinema when used with shrewdness can garner enough emotions within ignorant movie goers about nationhood to back the protagonist in whatever s he is doing that is what has happened in this movie   the art of good film making  tends to overlook and ignore finer aspects of women empowerment and digs more deep into the patriarchal systems to further strengthen patriarchal roles to build the womens liberation and freedom movement i hope some readers who are sensitive human being will try to understand the point i am making and deplore such popular presentation of regressive concepts on feminism despite its all time record breaking all india collection it confirms my review   indian is still a patriarchal society with male dominancehave a look at the film with those lenses", "story  good screenplay  good direction average actors all acted ordinarily except aamir who was above average due to few heart touching scenes music effective goodtoo much hype by patriots not knowing a good movie from a bad who are simply echoing the same words uttered by the bollywood celebs for their friend aamir i felt the movie was very predictable with lots of scenes were altered from reality for entertainment purposes yes it has emotions comedy action etc but is not a true movie at all except a few scenes such as fight sequences i believe a lot of people are just going to watch this due to the word of mouth coming from other bollywood celebs promoting the movie left right and centre the whole of india if not the world had more time at their hands due to the holiday season and everyone from marketing team to film producers directors actors friends media just

female prejudice    two daughters overcome heavy obstacles to become world famous indian wrestlers with the support and motivation of their father and trainer    it is a very colorful well made lighthearted entertainment the acting is fine and the characters are relatable     a drawback is that it is way too long for a one night movie and should have been made into a mini series     overlooking the abuse aspect  i think it is important to say that personally i dont agree with most of the methods the father used to train strengthen and harden his daughters as a lot of actually was serious child abuse their mother also acts as the passive typical enabler to make it worse the movie dismisses and jokes about the psychological hurt on the daughters as if it didnt do any damage in europe the father would have been jailed and the kids taken away by cps  i think it is a big misunderstanding to glorify abusive behavior but i guess indians still have to learn that you can motivate your children without abusing them", "tmdb_rating": 0.04686371100164204}, {"movie_name": "bohemianrhapsody", "review": ["this movie is a must see for any music and movie lover queen fan or no queen

loved it i heard queen music as i worked and raised my 4 children but never really knew the band it came from my children lived with queen music and totally identified with them especially in their band performances my grandson heard queen because his father played it all the time we saw this movie as a family and the movie was about family friends and loyalty the typical band movie is about rising to fame falling from fame this movie is about hanging together as family as loyal friends something we really need more of today the 2 15 time frame flies by and youre left wanting moremore

of the music one of my most favorite movies in 75 years", "wow i feel mind blown after watching the world premiere yesterday evening i am whether a megahuge queen fan although i really like many of their songs nor do i know how accurate the storytelling is  but i suppose pretty accurate since both brian may and roger taylor are co producers of the film but i found the movie both intoxicating and moving i have read some of the professional reviews and i cannot comprehend their search of documentary wisdom in this movie this is not a documentary but an entertaining story of one of the worlds most iconic bands and the film delivers on all aspects and the critics were so wrong about the song bohemian rhapsody upon its releaseas brian may pinpointed in the interview on the red carpet he found that the casting was excellent i dont remember the exact word he used but he is so right every major role is perfectly casted and all the band members are brilliant but i must emphasize rami maleks role as freddie it has oscar written all over it what he does is almost beyond comparison chapeau for even taking on this role and then delivering what he does even better although marginally than michael douglas in behind the candelabra and gwilym lee as brian may is also a bulls eye but malek really carries the production on his tiny shoulders it was like watching our beloved freddie all over againmany many memorable moments but the live aid performance recreated it is one of the best scenes i have ever seen   and i have seen lots and lots of films chapeau for directors and producers and the whole team for to me delivering the best film ytd in 2018", "i dont know how to elaborate more than this if you are 35 and younger you will understand after seeing this movie", "my wife and i both enjoyed this immensely we are queen fans and attended the tribute concert a after freddie diedthis film is extraordinary first and foremost for rami maleks performance the physical resemblance is only a small part of that he had freddies body language down to a teebut the crowning glory is the vocals they are absolutely mind blowing i dont know how they did it im assuming its freddies voice the lip sync is flawless if its malek singing the oscar is in the bagive heard there are some negative reviews floating around i find that astonishing i hope malek gets at least a few nominations for this he should get multiple awards", "i just saw the world premiere and oh boy let me tell you about itthis movie might not be a masterpiece but my heart is filled with such happiness and joy after watching it that i think its going to burst sorry for the cheesiness freddie mercury brian may roger taylor and john deacon are so exquisitely portrayed i sometimes forgot it wasnt them the performances were so on point and so powerful you could feel the energy burst through the screen \u00bfhave you seen the famous car scene in waynes world well now imagine a full room doing the same people couldnt help but sing along lets be honest its impossible not tooi laughed cried sang and wished i could have seen queen live this band will live forever", "this movie was a brilliant portrayal of the mixed up life and massive talent that was mercury  and that is in no way meant to diminish the other fabulous musicians who made up this wonderful band whilst freddies life and death are quite well documented his inner turmoil is not   this movie opens this up for all to see and highlights actions and individuals who had a large influence on his fragile life both good and horrendously bad if only he could have been happy with the knowledge that he had one of the best singing voices if not the best that ever fronted a rock band rami malek does a wonderful job of portraying him and in so many ways has captured his mannerisms to a tee loved it and listening to the music in an imax auditorium was brilliant", "for those of us of a certain age queen and especially freddie defined us sitting through this movie i had goosebumps the casting just works and watching the actors playing may and deacon youd be forgiven in thinking someone had access to a time machine even kenny everett was instantly recognisable i left this movie a strange combination of elated and terribly sad elated to hear the music watch the story and yet sad that freddie was so desperately lonely ultimately i think freddie would have approved of the whole thing his genius and flamboyance shone through truly brilliant", "rami malek will be forever one of my favorite actors since the day ive watched mr robot i knew he will be one of the biggest star someday freddie mercury is legend everyone loves him but not everyone knows his story freddy mercury is fearless but not everyone knows about his desperately lonely i dontt know how accurate the storytelling is but this movie is absolutely mind blowing and brilliant such a perfect tribute to the legendim not saying this movie is perfect or masterpiece infact this movie has some issues with the director and delayed but after i walk out of the theater my heart is filled with joy tears of happiness brought so many emotions thats how you know the movie is fantastic darling the casting was brilliant bravo i cant get enough with rami malek he obviously worked so hard rami malek pulls off an amazing performance he just brings freddie back to life and i dont think you will see any better film about freddie mercury again its an oppurtunity of a lifetime every aspects of this movie was executed beautifully also the whole cast was so close to perfection

made me feel that being eccentric and different is ok as long as you are you the film brought so many emotions   laughter sadness joy   very heart warming at times i forgot i wasnt actually watching the guys from queen   they all looked so like them   especially may and mercury i thought rami rocked the role massive respect to this guy would happily pay to go back in and watch it again my film of 2018", "i love it when it happens again and again critics are too lost in their purist world to see something well done just watch the movie it is worth your time", "quite simply the critics are wrong this is a fitting tribute to the best performer and band of all time", "one of the best movies of the year the performances are all excellent the music surpasses what i had imagined brings back the

times i ever remember my dad crying was when freddie died that love for queen has been passed on to my little boy so off we went a little disheartened i might add following the critic reviews to watch the movie ten minutes in my little boy turned to me and said  mum i love this already the film has you right from the get go i honestly dont know what movie those critics saw but it cant have been the same movie at times i forgot i wasnt watching the real queen i laughed i cried i got goosebumps i cried some more i absolutely loved every minute of it the cinema was packed out and as the credits drew the audience clapped and cheered something i have never experienced at a movie before do not be put off just go if you have kids take them too", "what a night this was i went to the world premiere in my local theatre with the purple carpet event on the big screen and all that jazzwhen i saw the first trailer i didnt think much about rami malek as freddie or the whole movie at all since the majority of biopics are generic and pretty much formulaic back then i even considered dropping sacha baron cohen a huge mistake but boy was i wrong malek shined like hes never shone before i think susie figgis outdid herself as a casting director hereever since i joined the casting industry i really started seeing what it means to work here how important this part of showbiz that is and how just a single miscast can ruin a project susie figgis is a veteran casting director known for many big and widely loved projects and she did well here she did extremely well up until the moment i joined this business i paid little to no attention to the actor ensemble with the exception of clear miscasts that just stood out and you couldnt unsee it but yesterday i just sat there mesmerized gwilym lee did an outstanding job portraying brian may in fact i forgot he wasnt him lucy boynton was one of my absolute favorites portraying mary austin and her love and devotion towards freddie and rami malek oh boy rami *was* freddie mercury while i was sitting there in the theatre and staring at the screen i didnt have a feeling i was watching actors play their parts i felt like i was watching queeni dont have much to say about the plot or the costumes the setting the cast everything was close to perfection a perfect balance of drama and comedy exactly how life isi was five when my dad came to me kneeled put his large and on my tiny shoulder and delivered the tragic news about freddie passing queen was basically the soundtrack of my upbringing so i didnt take the news too well i wept like ive just lost a dear friend dad and i spent the remainder of that afternoon blasting the tracks we oh so lovedqueen has been the soundtrack of my life therefore its impossible to have an unbiased opinion about rhapsody but i must admit i had my reservations at first but in the end i loved it the last twenty minutes of the film i spend sobbing and wiping the tears and mascara tracks from my cheeks i cant remember the last time i cried this much in a movie and i dont know if it was the music freddies tragic fate or the relationships he had both with lovers and his family or maybe it was an amalgam of everything but from the first minutes the movie started building up it rose block by block until the huge skyscraper that the story was finally concluded and all the lights turned on and it shined like a marvelous gemuntil this day live aid remains the biggest most epic music event in the history of civilization and it is remembered by millions and _bohemian rhapsody_ did it justice malek did justice to freddie and i left my seat long after the credits had stopped rolling the show must go on and it does", "bohemian rhapsody was one of my most anticipated movies of 2018 itd be quite strenuous to oblige to youll quite how crucial the band queen means to me and how much theyve inveigled myself as the person i am todayas a youngster i had been raised upon the newest hottest artificially publicized pop and rap tracks that were continuously featured on the most vouged radio stations at the time but in the corner of every auto tuned computerized feature i listened to i would often get to occasionally tango to a queen hitfreddie mercury and his band of bohemians are the quadruple handed culprits who peeked my interest in soulfull rock and roll music genres which conincidently have shaped me into the classic rock head i am presently not only that but the obscurities and lunacy of their lyrics especially from hits like bohemian rhapsody drove me into studying the arts of profoundly galvanized poetry lyricism literaturetheir music additionally has helped me power through numerous of my most emotionally conflicting encounters i had brawled with during my time here on planet earth this iconic band has been persisting alongside my life ever since i was born and thats something i cant declare about towards any other musician musical groupnow heres my consensusi am very very tied on this film on one hand i thought bohemian rhapsody tributed the story of freddie mercury for the most part judiciously mainly due to rami maleks immersive performance trust me if malek wasnt in this movie bohemian rhapsody wouldve crumbled to ashes apace with some of the biggest catastrophes of 2018 as a depiction and honory of a musical legend i was earnestly contented to witness the resultson the other hand i found this movie to be a pretty incoherent potboiler mess of a product the harshest way to submit this is well simply put to say that bohemian rhapsody is fundamentally your average company manufactured cop out strand of merchandise that was only fabricated for mainstream audiences who will unknowingly be able to eat up the same old fast and the furious family is important blueprint that theyve unconsciously seen billions of timeshowever this movie is dang lucky that they got malek on the project and that they at least managed to make a glaringly enthralling two hour sound explosion of a music videothe main core killing this movie so not gonna lie bohemian rhapsodys script is somewhat atrocious in my humble opinion this penmanship nearly lineaments everything i dont want in a based on a true story feature whose bright idea was it to make a marvel movie confided within a queen movie an arrangement which wasnt necessarily a construct that one should really consider for a freakin queen movie writers of the world you dont have to throw in a satirical one liner every twenty seconds in order to conquer your audiences attentionand my my like if you didnt think a movie could get more by the books clich\u00e9 especially when diving in with all the family is valuable and family acceptance mortalities than you sir or madam were wrong screenwriters ive been sounding so demanding recently i apologize i guess im just admittedly aggravated today stop making your dilagoue feel as if its sprouting out of the pages of a life coaching pamphlet its amateurish honestlythey just had to bend the story into little bits and pieces because they just had to insert their little chestnut morals and preaches and their superfluous forced humor why hollywood why probably because of production issues and what not oh and bryan singer supposedly and marketing and money definitely moneythe editing is a bit of a mess too the sequence of events are muddled like crazy youll needa do some final cuts on this darling and about 30% of the movie is just witnessing the band drag on from how they crafted one hit to how their next hit was created and so on so forthdid i just rant woah i totally did hmmlets lighten matters up i suppose i dont want to give off too many negative vibes about this mediocre biopic feature there is virtue to be foundbut rami malek this man carries this entire movie without him bohemian would like an atom bomb ornot like an atom bomb cause the song okay ill shut upmaleks performance is honestly oscar nominee worthy he embodies head to toe freddie mercurys everything even in the sentimental dramatic moments he kills sorry destroys it despite the poor script and dialogue hes often given additionally his chemistry and the story behind his love life was intriguing enough to keep me locked on the positive outcome of the film originates from this portrayal and this plotpoint that majorily has to do with who freddie was and what he had to accord with during his times of famei mildly relished bohemian rhapsody and i was enthralled whenever we got to relive mercurys tale buta queen movie deserves light years better than this im possibly being a tad bit generous offering bohemian rhapsody with this grade but i cant deny that i enjoyed and was cheery that i got to venture this film of messy yet dapper flairso verdict c+", "just watched bohemian rhapsody with my wife my 16 yo daughter and 14 yo son its quite simply one of the best movies weve ever seen rami maleks performance as freddie mercury is phenomenal and worthy of an oscar the other actors are great too the music is naturally magnificent were talking of queen after all we rated bohemian rhapsody 10 10", "after listening to the reviews calling bohemian rhapsody a bog standard bio i think its time for me to put my two cents in to the ringpersonally i must have been watching another movie or is that i just understood what the makers of bohemian rhapsody were trying to achieveactually lets start with just thatbohemian rhapsody is a tribute to the legacy of freddie mercury and also the band queen it was primarily made for the fans of the the band and to showcase the band and its history to a new audienceto do this the film primarily uses a straight forward story telling style this also means that events and time lines have to be condensed and fictionalised to tell that story in just over 2 hours this also means that many real characters have to amalgamate in to a couple of fictional personas i personally had no problem with this i also liked the fact that the film poked fun at future events using also comic casting those who have seen the movie will know what im talking about it seems to me that the critics wanted something that real queen fans have no real time for namely a movie that explores freddies wild private life we know what he did we know a lot about his wild side but queen fans want a film about the most important elements of freddies life namely the band and its musicbohemian rhapsody does something betterinstead of showing a debauched indulgent life bohemian rhapsody instead shows us a man trying to come to terms with his extraordinary life it shows how with the help of the truly talented other members of queen he was able to do that it also shows his joy his loneliness plus some of his mistakes and missteps along the way and of course his complex relationship with mary astor possibly the one person he truly lovedit tackles his sexuality and some of the aftermath of his partying it also shows the beginning of his illness this is all achieved with sensitivity and respectnow for the musicbohemian rhapsody is possibly at its greatest when recreating queen on stage using a mixture of real singing from the actors queen and freddies over dubbing and sound alike artists to create a totally unique feel to queens songs recreations of the bands greatest hits are mixed to sound fresher than ever some even help the movie to move along showing headlines and critics reviews as the songs play out then theres the live aid performance much like the real concert it almost dwarfs everything that has gone before on film we the audience really get to experience what it was like to be at that event not just from the crowd but from the bands point of view almost every highlight from that performance is featuredthe performanceseveryone agrees rami malek is a revelation as freddie after about 20 minutes you totally forget that this is an actor he is freddie this can also be said for gwilym lee ben hardy and joseph mazzello playing the rest of the band in fact in the case of lee the transformation into brian may is astounding as the film primary focuses on freddie you can feel a sorry that aspects of the other members of the band arent fully explored rogers womanising is hinted at but brians private life and his relationship with his father are not john deacon remains the enigma of the band lucy boynton gives a carefully measured and sensitive performance as mary astor coming to terms with the changes in freddies life unfortunately allen leech has the unenviable task of playing a composites of some of freddies lovers and can be seen as a bit of a cliche villain but he gives a good account of himself as for the rest of the cast everyone else is solidthe film begins with live ad and ends on that same dayif youre a fan of queen i defy you to leave your seat as the credits role to sum up bohemian rhapsody is a celebration not an expose and it should be treated that way by those pay their money to see it the critics obviously didnt get it", "ok its the opening day the cinema is packed probably 90% queen fans the fans ranged from a young girl of about 10 to old gits like medemi malek is awesome throughout he obviously worked so hard to not just look but to sound and act like freddie then again they all didthere have been some negative professional reviewer comments and i did read them and i really couldnt work out what they wanted   perhaps a mix of philadelphia story and mama miathe complex relationship between freddie and mary austin as well as paul prenterband finally jim hutton was explored and dealt with appropriate sensitivitypersonally i felt it was short and would have loved to peek more behind the curtain to understand where the music that shaped my adolescence came fromif youve never seen it go to youtube and watch the queen performance at live aid the reaction of the crowd wasnt overplayed it was if anything understatedby the way bryan singer is credited as director but he left and dexter fletcher stood in and made a pretty good jobwant to see it agai", "wow what a brilliantly made film brian singer the usual suspects x men has walked a sublime tightrope of a wonderful engaging funny and emotional film without turning it into a turgid hollywood smarm fest rami malek is of course the star and his performance as freddie is uncanny most of the vocals were freddies originals but he does attempt some of his ownwith commendable success and you quickly forget its not actually mr mercury himself unlike some biopics the music itself does by no means fall by the wayside and there is a multitude of queen classics crammed into the just over 2 hours running time and with roger taylor and brian may as the executive music producers for the film expect nothing less i was pleasantly surprised as to how much of the movie was dedicated to the music and if i wasnt in a cinema i would have spent half the time air guitaring and singing at the top of my voice of course we have a lot of the film dedicated to freddie and his declining social life behavior and ultimately health and this is handled with so much respect and emotion that at no point does it seem forced or uncomfortable the film follows a classic rise fall and rise again formula culminating in a final fist pumping rousing half hour which sees the band bust out what some say is the greatest live performance of all time as they re emerge for wembleys live aid concert realistically the film wont go down as an all time classic and may not be up for any oscars except for maleks performance maybe but what we do get is a barnstorming foot tapping heart pumping movie which for me is without a doubt one of the greatest music biopics ever made go see it", "im fan of queen& freddy himself but the same time i graduated film school and i love cinema thats why i also like to be as objective as possible in my reviews of movies here i will try to make my criticism honestyes sometimes professional film critics are deliberately malicious and their opinions are detached from reality but sometimes they are also right and in the case of bohemian rhapsody this is the secondfirst of all the film distorts a lot of facts from freddy and queens life and if it were not significant events   i would not care at all but these are important things and especially in a biographical film this should not be done just to make the movie more dramatic freds life was dramatic enough if only the creators of the film really wanted to make an interesting movie they would go even deeper into mercurys childhood and the fact he escaped with his family against persecution from his own homeland and this in turn could be the starting point   foundation for a deeper better portrait of the queen singerunfortunately there is no depth here the worst part is that this film is schematic completely flat only glides over important topics does not carry out any serious psychological analysis of such a fascinating complicated character that freddy was i dont accept excuses that this is the story of the band and not mercury himself because firstly one does not exclude the other it was possible to include in the scenario a deeper analysis   truth about freddy and the band and secondly the bands history is also poorly told the best moment of a rather boring long lasting first half of the movie is the recording of  bohemian rhapsody  the rest is a fast also quite jumping and chaotic montage of musical scenes depicting carelessly queen tours and writing of individual hits and while i understand that in a 2 hour movie it is not possible to show each creative process in the smallest detail it was still possible to show it better from the pov of the characters   band members thus also build better and deeper characters in this filmthe second half is better i admit both in terms of pace and in terms of writing story and the icing on the cake is the live aid concert the performance photography camera work acting of the main actor is at the highest level in this scene unfortunately it is not enough to save this movie from failuremaleks acting imo certainly doesnt deserve an oscar nomination he tries his best with an empty and schematic screenplay writers   directors mistakes are not his fault true but oscar is an award for outstanding acting performances which are not limited to robotic mannerism it must be accompanied by the psychological emotional depth of the portrayed character and there is no such depth in this film in this main character the only really emotional scene that attempts to penetrate into freddys soul is the scene of conversation in the rain it is here that maleks creation is the truest and the bestbut again  when we look at this role through the prism of the whole film majority of maleks work is the mentioned mechanical mannerism   perfectly recreated  but it is not enough to rate this role positively let alone reward it with an oscar nomination imitative mannerism gestures faces alone   it is only a skeleton an acting sketch especially in a biographical film and not a full beautiful complex image which should be any biography there is simply no soul in this act and its just a shame if you play a figure as extraordinary colorful and complicated as freddy mercury in addition to the obvious mistakes of screenwriters and director malek himself for me does not rise to the task sometimes he is just mercury caricature and large artificial teeth dont help to erase this impression in fact the opposite the make up department didnt do good job here famous teeth of queen frontman could have been done better much more subtly it would look less ridiculous returning to rami malek   he is still a young talent who   like any actor   needs more workshop and acting experience plus really good material to really shine that is why i predict rami malek will not win an oscari still think that the great mistake of the bohemian rhapsody creators was to part ways with sacha baron cohen when i found out that he had left mercurys biography project i felt it was a big mistake from film producers because i was sure cohen wanted to tell an uncompromising interesting story not forcedly smoothed  and it seems my intuition did not disappoint me then cohen a remarkable & colorful character like freddy would have fit in perfectly in this role in addition after hearing the interview in which cohen told why he finally left the movie and what vision of mercury he had   i regret even more that it was not him who played the queen main singer he wanted to portray freddy as a complicated controversial figure with a great appetite for life but also a great artist who mixed the big ego with great sensitivity and shyness   i have no doubt that it would be a great role now its just a missed opportunityas a result we got schematic polite movie ironically   because freddy mercury as well as the entire queen were as original unapologetic and creative as you could be and deserve much better sorry but real queen fan who wanted raw real complex deep uncompromising truth and story   just cannot like this movie mercury and all the queen story has so much potential wasted in this movie i guess ill just wait for another film bold and great this time i hope"], "sentiment": 0.2752296789679083, "tmdb_review": "if _bohemian rhapsody_ is so great why was the best part of it tom hollander saying a single word dont get me wrong rami malek deserves

masterfully woven cinematic universe beginning back in 2008 with iron man we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to and it did not disappoint thanos is a complex villain with deeper and more interesting desires than just world domination the dilemmas all the characters face in this movie both the heroes and the villains are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat no other set of movies has beeen so involved so expanded and encompassed so many story lines characters and previous movies the sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline", "over the past decade marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt the studio has consistently delivered smart funny brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic book origins the 18 blockbuster movies produced since iron man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre   theyve helped to legitimise it indeed marvels two most recent films   thor ragnarok and black panther   have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks and yet its perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about avengers infinity war this is a blockbuster film thats been ten years in the making its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies it features 30 or so characters each with their own complex backstories and motivations and all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe it sounds ridiculous and feels impossible but thats precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement masterfully directed by anthony and joe russo infinity war is bold brainy filmmaking at its very best the kind that will lift your spirits blow your mind and shatter your soul   occasionally in the same scene it demonstrates on an epic scale what marvel has known all along that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story for all its blockbuster spectacle and theres almost too much of that the film works because its anchored by the heart humour and humanity of its charactersthe films basic plot is simple thanos played via motion capture by josh brolin intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction has long been on the hunt for the six infinity stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe he dispatches his acolytes to earth to retrieve the time stone currently in the possession of dr stephen strange benedict cumberbatch and carve the mind stone out of the forehead of vision paul bettany its a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes weve come to know and love   from the avengers to the guardians of the galaxy   must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe from the outset its immediately clear that neither the films directors nor screenwriters christopher markus and stephen mcfeely are interested in playing it safe most other superhero films are bled of high stakes   the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma but its a super safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive theres no such guarantee here within the first ten minutes we are confronted with the dark twisted depths to which thanos and his acolytes in the black order will sink in order to achieve their goals death as well as genuine loss and sacrifice is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives infinity war ever forward and the film is all the better for it thats not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience whats so impressive about infinity war is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods when its funny and it very often is its deeply truly funny the film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon mixing and matching ones youd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter peter quill chris pratt is floored by thors chris hemsworth godly muscles bruce banner mark ruffalo is charmed by the wit and intelligence of shuri letitia wright and itd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by peter dinklages inspired cameo its a blithely tongue in cheek sensibility shared by marvels best comic books which understand that humour can make you care when it really countsand boy does infinity war make it count there are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film from the charming surrogate father son dynamic shared by tony stark robert downey jr and peter parker tom holland to the undeniable love that ties vision and wanda maximoff elizabeth olsen together in many ways the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love but to love fiercely and beyond all logic its right there when the unfailingly noble steve rogers chris evans declares we dont trade lives even when giving up one could save billions theres even a chilling echo of it in thanos himself a lesser film would have turned thanos into a one dimensional villain much the way hes all monster and maniac in the comic books in infinity war however thanos end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today there is as it turns out method to thanos madness it makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters gamora zoe saldana and nebula karen gillan all the more unsettling for the most part infinity war does justice too to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film the russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in captain america civil war and they do so again here with twice as many characters even the most minor of supporting players like don cheadles james rhodes war machine are given story beats that land it helps that marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight even so there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast emotionally speaking this is downeys film he plays every note of tonys reluctant courage and bone deep trauma as he embarks on what hes convinced is a suicide mission hes ably matched by cumberbatch who finds vulnerability even in his characters most cunning and calculative move hemsworth meanwhile is given free rein to import the big hearted comedic swagger of thor ragnarok into this film   while also layering it with a deeply felt jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of thanos and the universein a film with so many moving parts some elements dont work quite as well a couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront   including an original avenger or two   fade into the background the film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene and while most of them are fantastically choreographed there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent thanos from clenching his fist in effect this is a superhero m\u00eal\u00e9e thats part over the top and part overkill and might prove too much for those who dont already care for this franchise and the characters in itminor quibbles aside though infinity war is yet another step in the right direction for marvel it continues the studios tradition of placing a premium on rich complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences but it also refuses to make things easy for itself the film ends even more bravely than it began with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure its a stroke of bold brilliant genius   a narrative risk so audacious that youll want to follow marvel wherever it goes next", "summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like epic spectacle and smash as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales the summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with avengers infinity war and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the marvel cinematic universe when thanos josh brolin embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the infinity stones he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path when his pursuit leading him to earth bruce banner mark ruffalo and doctor strange benedict cumberbatch who enlist a reluctant tony stark robert downey jr to the cause just as the minions of thanos arrive with the avengers fractured and scattered following the events of captain america civil war the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team this allows for a great entry by the guardians of the galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic you have a story with the guardians as well as one with many of the key avengers as well as others with characters old and new as such it is like a guardians avengers and marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect while the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye popping action sequence what really impressed me the most was that the russo brothers never let the fx of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other there are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any marvel film to date many fans had expressed disappointment with avengers age of ultron for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a marvel fan would want in a film i was also surprised by how well thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type i am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene believe the hype avengers infinity war is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be 5 stars out of ", "i was amazed to see so many negative reviews so many people are impossible to please this movie was 2 1 2 hours long but i could have sat there another 2 1 2 hours and not noticed thoroughly entertaining and i love how the directors werent afraid to take chances ive read a lot of other user reviews that claim that theres no plot unless youre mentally handicapped or not paying attention because youre on your phone the entire movie the plot is pretty clear and decent in my opinion", "i absolutely loved this movie it was intense action packed and emotional also delivering comedy when needed but it was a relatively dark film all of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that theyre superheroes this is easily the best superhero movie ever made thanos is one of the best villains of the mcu as well as one of the best of cinematic history in general upon first viewing i hated him but found his character intriguing similar to emperor palpatine in the original and prequel trilogies of star wars the more times i rewatch it though i start to understand thanos point of view more and more the blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling even driving some people to say that thanos was right in all this i wouldnt go that far but i would say his character is misunderstood definitely a compelling villain in thanos the ending of the movie was insanely emotional but i love how they mainly set aside the original avengers team to take on thanos in the fourth avengers movie i for one cannot waitthat eerie thanos will return at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine it truly is the end game now and i cant wait to see the avengers rise up and likely defeat thanos in the next movie+every hero has their moment to shine much like the villain wants the movie achieves balance in this way +good comedic moments to balance again pun intended the dark tone of the film +emotional and heavy ending seeing earths mightiest fail is something devastating to watch +complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years +incredible performances +phenomenal original score  etc not much you can find thats wrong with this movie its literally the perfect movie marvel has been building up to for 10 years and those that claim it didnt have an ending as a negative i beg to differ just because the villain won doesnt mean it didnt have an ending my rating 10 1", "all the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls idiots or didnt are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for infinity war because of their fundamental lack of understanding its like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot its utterly ridiculousthere have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point all 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war infinity war is the end game movie there is nothing left to explain nothing left to discuss it is all out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence the infinity stones there have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and or the heroes that come together to fight thanos in this movie its like a long game of chess where thanos finally makes his move and its a huge oneso i beg of any of you who reads this dont listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot has no reason and is only fighting they arent worth listening to infinity wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death and the movie is done to near perfection the movie is glorious the cgi is fantastic the battles are awe inspiring and thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning he is truly the mad titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes anyone who doesnt think this clearly didnt see the same movie", "im almost wordless andlotr is my no1 movie of all time and avengers infinity war is another lotr to me still i love lotr better but its just because lotr filled with great motivational messages this is the only difference put aside this iw = lotr or maybe even better than lotr hat off marvels avengers infinity wa", "i went and looked and i want to express my thoughtsi went to this film with very high expectations with a sense of something i went to him twice the first time myself and the second with the family and i was even surprised that my mother sister and dad who do not understand this movie at all brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotionseach frame each scene does not let you get bored from the marvel logo and to the stage after the credits favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath in comparison with the war of infinity even the confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandboxuuuu and the villain the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy he is not just a bot at once without motivation no its just the opposite i liked thanos so much that you do not want to and he began to impress me in terms of his convictions i had it only once with joker heath ledger he has feelings he makes choices hes alivetense scenes are beautiful in one moment i still let off a meager male tear and this happens to me very very rarely what about the humor the jokes are correct for me and they do not bother you like thor ragnarok although in the beginning they look a little tight well the action it is very high quality and in comparison with the black panther is generally idealand of course the film can not be without punctures the lack of predictability of some story lines and a couple of moments that were very predictable but they are fade against the background of all this scaleyes you will not find anything in this film about something something but what what what steep humor thanks to marvel and of course the rousseau brothers the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that ive been waiting for for 3 yearsout of 10 i give the war of infinity 9", "engrossing epic emotional those are the three es that define this movie the latest instalment of the marvel cinematic universe franchise is at its very best culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre  so lets start with anthony and joe russo the geniuses that made this beast of a movie after announcing that they will be directing the next two avengers movies marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest avengers movie yet yes it was very dark with more of a serious tone more than winter soldier and civil war previous marvel movies directed by the russo bothers combined but they also had what the other avengers movies had as well the humour and it was not at all tasteless nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie this is by far the russo brothers best work among the marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to its highest praise to christopher markus and stephen mcfeely for writing the amazing script they also wrote the scripts of captain america the avengers winter soldier age of ultron and civil war also known to be the best marvel movies  now the characters and story practically everyone that youve seen in the previous marvel movies that arent dead are in this movie everyone had the chance to shine even if its the smallest way possible there were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline makes you jump scream gasp or cry  and of course the one and only thanos the villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers josh brolin officially portrays the best villain in the mcu completely pissing on marvels villain problem he brings all out on the table with everything hes got not only will you hate thanos by the end of the movie but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds they brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a marvel villain they made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable the motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie making the movie all about him  i cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then i would be spoiling all i have to say is that whether youre a marvel fan or not and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies go and watch it it will not be a waste of your time or money digest this to prepare for whats to come i may be bias once again but i just have to i have to rate this movie 10 10 if i dont i would be betraying myself", "well well welli was so ready to tear this down   19th mcu film too many stars bloated cgi first of a two parter and so on and so onyet this is so much fun pure popcornnow in the dictionary under popcorn film is just the poster for this film somehow the russo brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun they are helped immensely by two things the premise is so pure mcguffin that you just watch thanos look for infinity stones which gives a primal momentum and that the films stars characters are looking to move on   that means actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying eitherthe dc people must be kicking themselves the lightness and comedic touches are brilliant you are laughing out loud comedy level but at totally organic character humour it means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running timethe other big surprise is thanos himself normally i hate cgi characters but somehow they have made thanos and josh brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc this is one of the better mcu villains and i never thought i would write thatthe stakes are real the charisma levels are amazing it is like oceans 28 and i cant wait for the sequelthat says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced", "remember its fast does not have time for crap scenes everyone is lucky to get a line hard to catch on for non mcu guys but i gotta say awesome", "this movie was an underwhelming chaotic blend of several different movies im going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work ill start with the villainthanos as a whole is a pretty good villain he is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script the problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent guardians of the galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are but infinity war seems to forget that in the battle on titan iron man and about five others are able to hold thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off at this point thanos has four infinity stones sorry but there is no way they could restrain him at that point  infinity war also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction collectively they are called the black order or dark order and their names are never said so ill give them nicknames there is noseless the terriblewho is terrible avatar lady with horns also terrible rock dude basically korg but bigger with a goatee and guy with pointy axe the only people who understand who the heck these characters are are marvel comic fans the biggest problem with infinity war is the character developments and inconsistencies ill describe the worst casesstar lord when the first guardians of the galaxy came out star lord was a great character infinity war completely ruins him he turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot there are brief flashes of the old star lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise at one point during the battle on titan thanoss home planet iron man doctor strange and the guardians of the galaxy have thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet which makes no sense in the first place because at this point thanos has four feakin infinity stones as they are removing the glove from thanoss hand star lord finds out that thanos killed gamora earlier in the movie  star lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from mantiss mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy vision the development of vision is also really really bad in age of ultron he is strong enough to wield thors hammer but in infinity war he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot thor so in thor ragnarok it was established that thor is the god of thunder and doesnt need a hammer to be powerful then in infinity war they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll in fact he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon did the directors forget about what got established in ragnarok or did they just make thor weak because once again it fits the plot and marvel can get away with whatever the heck they wantscarlet witch wow her character was inconsistent one minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off thanos who has five infinity stones at this point for an extended period of time once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene hulk so apparently the hulk is now scared to come out ahh poor little guy this is a terrible plot twist and really doesnt make much sense another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters i was worried that it might be too many and it was as a result there were too many different subplots going on and they couldnt even have one final battle they had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of cgi filled action for the last forty five minutes of the movie now ill discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief descriptionnew york battle 2 10 this battle was absolutely terrible noseless the terrible comes in with the rock dude and tears up the city to take doctor strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling the action in alicia vikanders tomb raider was better than the action in this battlewakanda battle 8 10 this battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action the first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though it also gets annoying because its only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on titan or thor forging his hammer axe thingy overall though this battle was good and part of the reason that i give infinity war a 6 and not something much lowerbattle on titan 6 10 while there is some good action in this battle there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around thanos and how powerful he is overall i wasnt super impressedi also need to discuss thanoss plan for a second he wants to wipe out half of the universes population because the universe is overcrowded then he can finally rest did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing i definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth finally i am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes avengers 4 really predictable so at the end of the movie thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed somehow by random selection all the original avengers survive the odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing the characters that die are almost all new characters like black panther spiderman doctor strange etc several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything its just too predictableoverall infinity war was not a very good movie i do not understand the hype it was choppy inconsistent overcrowded and overall just not the great movie its cracked up to be i would not recommend going to the theater for this one i left feeling exhausted and tired of the mcu", "i dont mean to be negative here but avengers infinity wars 89 on imdb is entirely undeserved marvel superfan or not this movie has nothing on films like the dark night la la land pulp fiction or inception all films which it either outranks based on its 89 rating or comes close to i get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film and its awesome to see our favorite marvel characters come together the guardians of the galaxy thor spiderman captain america black panther etc but we shouldnt let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that avengers infinity war is an overly long movie that relies on cheap unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isnt particularly well written or edited i commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories but the movie just felt too long its fight scene after fight scene and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny the film isnt really original and its only redeeming factor is that its full of characters we all know and love its funny to see thor poke fun at the guardians of the galaxy and to see iron man and spiderman interact with doctor strange but when we look at the film objectively its really just a standard superhero film with more superheroes than normal that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion no matter how much we love marvel we all know that theres no way any of the characters who died are actually going to die the filmmakers expect us to believe that black panther who just made marvel over one billion dollars spiderman and the guardians of the galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises i hate to say it but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value and its cheap from a technical perspective the fight scenes are directed well but thats about it the editing isnt particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes i feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better overall avengers infinity war could have been amazing but its too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype this film is not deserving of its 89 rating on imdb i think that captain america civil war was a *much* better movie65 out of 10", "oh my god what an incredible film ive never done a review of a movie before ive only done tv shows so bare with me im gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two but to start offwow this film could be the best marvel movie ever but i will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that it absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since iron man 1 how far weve come in a quick 10 years is remarkable the thanos character absolutely hit the mark he was menacing intimidating vicious and so much more props to the actor who played him thanos plan succeeds for the time being and we get a whole lot of death because of it in this movie there was death and death the former refers to characters such as loki vision and gamora we saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind for this movie not to lose credibility these characters in my opinion must remain dead now death refers to what we saw at the end thanos with all infinity stones clicked his fingers and half of humanity including half of the avengers important to note that all the original avengers are still alive dissolved into dust giving the impression of death i expect these characters to come back at some point during the next avengers film most likely due to the originals saving them my final theory regards doctor strange on the ship with stark and spidey strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over stark and spideys lives however in the end we see strange give up the stone to thanos on the condition stark stay alive my prediction is that when strange saw all the possible futures the only future in which they win must heavily rely on tony stark which makes sense tony started it all so he should finish it incredible film cant wait for the next one to see how it all resolves 98 1", "there is literally no way to dislike this movie people complain about humor use your brains and you will see that the humor is necessary yet high quality there are no mistakes in any of the aspects of the movie some minor plot holes but thats it its a solid 95 movie an epic journey with more than 20+ characters russo brothers managed to an amazing movie with that many caharacters this is literrally the hardest movie ever in cinema history and they succeeded amazingly which zack snyder dc couldnt do with that terrible movie batman v superman only 2 or 3 main characters pathetic stop giving bad reviews because of humor you cant understand infinity war is a masterpieceacting = perfect 10 10 soundtrack = perfect 10 10 cgi visuals = perfect 10 10 thanos cgi is unique there is no other cgi as good as it story = almost perfect 98 1", "this movie has made me feel things that i havent about a movie in a very long time if you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of everything is gonna be alright because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is the emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on dont get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more im definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next avengers movie", "this is by far the best marvel film since the winter soldier", "just wow  the russo nailed it hand down from me they did it again part by part is interesting to watch  some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad thanos is the best villain ive ever seen he not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones one of the best part of it the team up guardian & avengers just amazing full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together for 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in avengers 4 really hype about itreally worth watching it  if u non marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch  really enjoy it  of course every good movie always have some issue with it but just minor issue can close eye and let it go going to watch it again soon  love from malaysia", "the most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word i have to say that infinity war was brilliant on each scale whether be its story visual effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the marvel characters every marvel fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie", "tldra phenomenal achievement   10 years of films leading up to this has been worth itsimple story allowing so much to be packed ininfinity stones are more than just dull mcguffinsa wildly different story and structure to most superhero filmsstructure more like a game of thrones episode   this works to its benefitthe ending is bold and brave   a real strength of the film as a wholeall characters are fantastic   their interaction is the greatest joy of the movieno one character hogs the film   everyone gets their fair share of screen timethanos is the greatest marvel villain so farabsolutely hilarious and very quotablesublime varied and non stop action that never feels like too muchsets up avengers 4 very wellthe greatest marvel film yet                                                              wow just wow for a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release its incredible when it not only meets expectations but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered there are so many words to describe marvels latest   emotional epic fun stressful scary hilarious incredible in about 2 and a half hours you will laugh you will cry and you will cheer its a phenomenal achievement the biggest marvel of marvel yet and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film you dont need to be a fan to love this filmits a very simple story without lots of twists and turns making it very easy to follow   that is provided youve seen all or at least most of the films so far for those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series everything will make sense and the characters are already known by letting the previous films set everything up that allows infinity war to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word go the ever important infinity stones themselves are much more than simple mcguffins   the film makes the audience care about them thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects its not just as simple as thanos collecting six stones however instead this doesnt follow the usual superhero story or structure instead being utterly unpredictable allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs this is a very different type of superhero film marvel able to break away from the mould this is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it this is best seen in the ending which will go down in history along with the likes of the italian job its a bold brave finale   in a way i would have preferred a slightly more rounded end but the film is too daring for that instead setting things up for avengers 4 perfectly even in the post credits sceneconsidering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters all seen through the structure of the film itself structured more like an episode of game of thrones we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head one moment well be with iron man dr strange and spider man the next were journeying across the galaxy with thor and the guardians and next we find ourselves with cap falcon and black widow no character seems particularly side lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen timewhereas age of ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters infinity war is the complete opposite the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself its a relief then that besides all characters having a fair amount of time they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film every group seeping excellent chemistry it never feels forced or gimmicky but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together it also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly with so many characters a film like this shouldnt work but incredibly it does and is all the better for it none of the groups are ever the default boring one unlike frodo and sam in lord of the rings but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines on top of that theyre all hilarious as ever drax might be the funniest but there are jokes from stark strange quill groot rogers okoye the list is endless in a film with so much heart and action its amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy its beginning to sound like a clich\u00e9 but this is absolutely the funniest marvel film yet   certainly funnier than the majority of comedies that come out these days even the new character eitri played by game of thrones peter dinklage gets his share of laughs the biggest surprise with regards to characters however is thanos while his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary ebony maw played by tom vaughan lawlor infinity wars central villain thanos is an exceptional antagonist brilliantly played by josh brolin as terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be there is a quiet emotional side to him unlike many villains hes not looking for power for the sake of power theres an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what hes doing is for the good of the universe this is not an antagonist to add to the ever growing annals of forgettable villains   thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted no longer will loki be the best marvel bad guy by default will he go down as the best superhero villain since the jokerof course its not all laughs and chasing stones as expected in a film like this theres action   lots of action its appropriate that the word war appears in the title since this is by far the most action packed marvel film weve seen despite the nigh on non stop action it never gets boring or seems like too much with a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles no two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh its a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another the cgi and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed definitely worthwhile being seen in imaxthe biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next with no clues in the upcoming ant man and the wasp or captain marvel in the interim since theyre set before the events of this film still if the next avengers film is anything like infinity war were in for another incredible treat with terrific character interaction hilarious comedy sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night   its all perfect the 10 years marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it a splendid and monumental achievement all hail marvel   but beware thanos will return", "just neglect the so called reviewsits personal views and differs from person to personmake your own review and keep it to yourself", "avengers infinity war is the seventh film in phase three of the marvel cinematic universe and the nineteenth film overall directed by the russo brothers captain america the winter soldier and captain america civil war it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten yearstwo years after the events of captain america civil war the avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes with some completely dropping off the radar altogether however one day the powerful intergalactic tyrant thanos josh brolin arrives on earth to complete his collection of infinity stones which upon acquiring all six will allow him to control half of the known universe with time quickly running out the avengers must reunite and team up with the guardians of the galaxy to put an end to thanos unquenchable thirst for poweravengers infinity war is more than a typical mcu superhero film it is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun while the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings the films ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed directors anthony and joe russo do a superb job developing thanos personality outside of simply wanting universal domination his motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic despite the films darker tone there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes particularly between tony stark robert downey jr and steven strange benedict cumberbatch as is the tradition be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scenei rate it a solid 9 1", "in the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops the action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action this could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous the only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is thanos and he is an interesting figure and i fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books but one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise and i do not in any way blame them for this but when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal i really cant bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer for the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue    the day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day i will respect marvel after watching this movie i feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure peter quill is just like they did with danny rand in the defenders", "do not listen to these people this is an amazing movie one of the best openings in the mcu people keep saying there is no story to this movie in which case they are incredibly stupid as this movie follows the story of the infinity gauntlet comics from the 1990s where thanos takes all the infinity stones from the avengers heroes and eliminates half of all life in the universe which is exactly happens in this movie as it is a part 1 of 2 story this is the defeat and part 2 is the victory thats how this is set up so dont go into this movie expecting anything like character development or a more fleshed out world just expect war a massive fight across worlds where our heroes try to stop thanos and fail in my own personal opinion this is a masterpiece for 3 reasons 1 all these characters combining into 1 big massive team is done incredibly well 2 we have seen easily the greatest marvel movie villain ever for the first time in action and finally 3 this is easily the most fun and emotional experience ive had with a marvel movie since the first avengers movie a solid 10 10 for me and hopefully more people after me", "merely 5% is

the movie and immediately told all my fellow mcu fans they need to see it then i hop on here and see negative review after negative review and i disagree with most of them feels like i was in a different movie only thing i will agree with was bad is the fact that we dont know of a captain marvel weakness shes insanely overpowered but i mean so is scarlet witch if you think about it scarlet witch could take down any of the avengers if she wanted to and she sorta did in ultron when she was making all of them see their worst fears by the way why has she not done that since that movie but thats besides the point the only weakness scarlet witch has had was her love for vision but that wasnt introduced until later in her story so i dont think its bad that we dont know captain marvels weakness yet this is the mcu she will have more storyline this was just setting up for more to come i actually think brie larsons acting was great we learn very early in the movie that her characters being trained to control her emotions and impulses thats the only thing she knows as she has no prior memories of course shes a little flat because of that but then i find her character builds and develops as now she has the powers to match her confidence and ambition which gives her even more purpose she starts regaining her memories and you can see her unfold as she feels love her old friend and the daughter she stands up against the kree people who she used to trust and shows them shes better off without them she gives the skrulls a chance and ends up fighting for them and giving up her renewed life on earth for them i find her to be a very different character towards the end than she is in the beginning do people keep forgetting that this movie takes place in the 90s this was an early beginning story for both fury and coulson neither of them have gone through any of the crap they soon will so i think its well done that their characters were quite different they will develop with time if you watch this movie then all the other marvel movies in chronological order itd be more clear they also joke that coulson is the new guy which to me explains his slightly timid attitude i went into this movie trying to not let the politics affect my opinion if you go into the movie already with a bad taste in your mouth you might be disappointed and i in no way support some of the things brie larson has said and done but i dont find that any of that was brought into the movie and i am capable of letting those two instances be separate i dont have to love and support every actor actress in a movie in order to love the movie i am a female in my mid 20s and i felt very empowered by this movie my 29 year old brother felt empowered i feel like this movie is intended to be motivational for all audiences and doesnt try to tear anyone down goose was amazing and adorable up until he eats the bad guys that was weird and uncomfortable to me but ok still love goose is it the best marvel has done no but i am overall very pleased with the movie and will be seeing it again and again i just wish it gave us more teasers towards the rest of the avengers and endgame but i guess i can wait another month for that if i have to", "while the movie was enjoyable to watch at times i felt like i was watching it just so i wouldnt become lost in future marvel films captain marvel was underwhelming regrettably i truly wanted this to be a knock out unfortunately the ko was my attention i found myself moving a lot and becoming bored  waiting for the marvel to really take flight most of the jokes and 90s pop culture references felt lackluster and forced remember that song guys here it is i felt bries performance was yawn able at best maybe mis casting or mis direction is to blame but something was off the tone felt like a juggling act this doesnt feel like a film that is to bring the fourth phase of the mcu and more like thor 2 dark world all in all blah blah blah i only read this chapter to finish the bookmaybe my opinion will change in the future or when disney gives me money so i can sell out ya friggin turds but i need more than hentai cats to stay engaged", "i enjoyed this movie its an ok movie the kind of movie that wouldve gone under the radar if it wasnt because it ties to the avengers and the polemic around brie larssons personaif anything captain marvel piggy bagged on the avengers fandom because otherwise mist people wouldnt be interested in this version of a female supermansamuel l jackson the cat and the aliens save the movie and make it worth the ticket not so much the captain marvel character and her story line", "ive liked brie larson in other films but she showed zero range in this when your main character in a superhero movie is unwatchable you already have a problem in addition captain marvel has no weaknesses which kills the tension immediately there is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing or any danger at all for that matterits an ok origin story but it makes no sense as to why shes supposedly so powerfulthe cat was good", "one of the worst films that i have ever seen the story line was drab the acting was terrible and plot holes everywhere people actually walked out the cinema i even fell asleep for 20 mins i cannot recommend this film at all if the film was food in a restaurant i would have asked for my money back total rubbis", "this movie is pretty close to the same thing as a moon pie", "this movie is by far the worst mcu movie it almost seem like they they didnt really care about this movie when they were making it nothing was interesting about this movie not her past or how she got her powers not nick furys accident if you know what i mean not ronin not even where it left off the movie never had my attention to the point where i thought hey thats pretty cool ant man was a way better movie and so was wonder women just in case people think im hating cuz shes a women the expectation was very high for this movie and unfortunately it did not deliver considering its right before avengers maybe timing was a big factor also if they would have done this film as one of the first ones i dont think it would have been that bad nonetheless it is definitely not worth watching in the theater it almost seemed like they targeted young girls who are working on their dreams as an audience and maybe inspire them not to give up who knows so many things wrong with this movie", "nothing in this movie made sense the plot holes in this movie were horrible and the writing was no better the movie tried to pull a momento but it failed the movie starts in the middle and ends with telling her back story that was horrible then nick fury right after finding captian marvel he brings danvers to a secret facility not even knowing anything about her that is housing a test hyper drive without even knowing who she is when danvers gets kidnapped she gets hooked up to the supreme intelligence they make marvel a woman which makes no sense and on the record player you hear the song come as you are by nirvana which debuted in 1992 but she was first kidnapped by the cree in 1989 which means she would have never known of that song carol danvers apparently has no flaws and nothing to lose unlike every other hero ever which makes no sense fury losing his eye to the cat is so cringy and danvers is not the first avenger but apparently fury makes her the first which make no sense because captain america was the first avenger it even says it in the mcu titles last but not least the skrull are not and have not been at any point in time refugees they have been war mongers quit trying to make everything in the movies political because you dont like the president we go to the movies to escape the world not for you to shove your politics down our throats", "i would have given it a huge zero worst marvel studios franchise film ever just read all of the bad reviews from thousands of others nuff said ps thanks stan as always but not for this film", "firstly the movie   very boring brie is probably now one of my dislikes actresses and if i see her name on a movie i wont be watching it   she cannot act no facial expressions no variations in tone essentially no acting   shes like a robot the cat was funny fury was great and the rest of it was just terriblelooking at the box office returns people might say well it did great at the box office so it must have been greatthe fact is lots of people went to see it only because it was a mcu movie and have grown to expect a high quality entertaining experience every time with mcu   call it a safe bet for a fun time until now that is lots of previous marvel fans will be thinking twice about just automatically going to see a mcu movie in the future thanks to how terrible this one wasdont waste your hard earned on this at the cinema wait for it to hit netflix or just dont even bother and wait for endgam", "i dont want to offend enyone with my review but im just trying to be truthful and realistic this absolutely the worst movie that marvel ever made its not connected it is not elaborated good enough how come that ordinary man woman can absorb energy more powerful than infinity stone in this marvel universe its not possible for humans this is so disappointing it should have been more like the comics", "there isnt much positive to say about captain marvelas much as i wanted to like this film i just couldnt brie larsons performance is underwhelming and she doesnt give the feeling of a strong female lead especially for a character as powerful and important as captain marvel her performance is utterly forgettable and i developed no sense of pathos with her characterthe fight scenes lack excitement and in fact the whole film from beginning to end lacks the pace and energy of other marvel films such as thor ragnarok or doctor strangethe effects are flashy and colourful but that isnt enough to keep me engagedsamuel l jackson puts in a solid performance as fury but i cant help but feel he is drowning in mediocrity in this moviethe film on multiple occasions tries to make a point with feminist pandering   the scene at the end where captain marvel blasts and then drags jude law is just pointless and is clearly only there to show that captain marvel has girl power   the fight was already overthere is also a moment which made me just think really   when the young girl tells her mum to go on an incredibly dangerous and life threatening mission   i get the point the film is trying to make   women can fight evil just like men   and this is true but i doubt someones 10 year old daughter would realistically tell them to go and face a very real risk of death facing the prospect of being orphaned she also appears to be a single mum so she would have ended up in a care home should anything go wrongoverall the film is lazily written poorly directed and suffers from the current hollywood trend of making a movie to tick boxes rather than actually making a decent piece of art you can make a film with a strong female lead in an action movie and not make a massive deal out of the fact that she is a woman   the hunger games and the resident evil films are good examples of this", "the 21st in an ongoing storyline of a 20 run movie streak & a month before the most anticipated movie of all time avengers 4 this movie was always going to make moneybut could the film makers deliver a quality movie when they are so caught up in gender identity & social justice politics sadly noi loved jude law & his kree team in this movie gemma chan was melt in your mouth & still break a tooth cool i could easily have watched a good movie about these guys called kree skrull war not what we got thoughbrie larson as captain marvel looked sad uncomfortable awkward & angry the entire movie her appearance did not look heroic any captain marvel cosplay i have seen looked better than her & it never looked like she enjoyed the role or costumenick fury the character in almost half the mcu movies is ruined in this movie & his origin & that of his infamous missing eye is thrown out for cheap laughs that fell completely flat for him to get his eye scratched out by a ridiculous mcguffin is film heresy & the writers should never work in film againthe skrulls first outing & origin is also ruined in this film for 57 years in comics & cartoons they have been the coolest & bad ass enemies of the fantastic four x men & avengers but in this movie for a social commentary they are made into sympathetic refugees 2 3s into the movie & ruin any chance of telling some of the greatest stories in the mcucaptain marvels powers were completely inconsistent the entire movie also sometimes she could be beaten by jude law or normal humans or an average skrull & her photon blasts were just that a lame light show that mostly did nothing also cm received her powers from the cosmic cube being shot at but jude law was also caught in the blast & received a concussion instead bad writingover all i gave this movie a 3 or 4 out of 10 for 2 3 of the movie & watched it reluctantly entertained until the final 1 3 when it completely $hit the bed the ending was so poorly written & executed it went down to a 2 10 with absolutely no chance of redemption a real blown opportunity & the first fail in the mcu", "so i was hoping this would be a great movie and i could write a review telling misogynists to shut up because its fantastic to have a strong female superhero as a lead character alas in that regard wonder woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole the acting is not that great between brie larsons poor performance and the prosthetic gci on samuel l jackson that makes him look younger but also gives him an expressionless wooden appearance there are very obvious plot holes like wait how did they know to do that and the pacing is very uneven there are a few parts during which i didnt feel engaged at all on the plus side it does fairly well as an origin story and there is that marvel level of polish in special effects and editing all in all it might be a necessary introduction to captain marvel for avengers end game but it is probably the weakest mcu movie to date", "even though the plot of marvel movies is pretty much straight forward and not very complicated in all of their movies bad guys doing bad things   good guys doing things to stop them this one is just extra boring and too correct in every way marvel movies have used to be fun and entertaining but this one failed to do that the main character is neither cool or charming no sense of humour and no charisma cgi is good as always but story is dull the whole thing feels forced and not very logical not even for a superheroes universe", "i am a marvel fan i go see all the movies then buy the blu rays i have character statues posters and have read the comics including captain marvel there is a reason people become fans of certain things and those things done well over time generate more fans until it becomes a juggernaut like the mcu has i fear that its not unstoppable however as the sub par captain marvel has painfully illustrated the movie is a pastiche of poorly written scenes with a bit of uninspired action sprinkled here and there with barely any plot at all carol danvers has no character development whatsoever no adversity to overcome besides amnesia and no villain to fight i know there are people saying they like this movie but i feel like they either arent being honest or they like it for personal reasons that are not present in the movie objectively speaking in terms of the technical aspects of storytelling captain marvel just isnt effective subjectively i was bored the entire time and the nostalgia parts made me feel as though jj abrams was poking me in the ribs asking me if i member the 90s yes yes i do and for the record people are criticizing this movie because it was bad not because they haaaate the wooomans dismissing legitimate criticisms using this tactic will not produce better films which is the only thing most people want the problem is that they built the movie around the idea of strong woman and promoted it as an identity film so when the movie ends up being bad some people rush to defend it because they dont want the idea to fail the movie itself is secondary   just a vehicle to slap their bumper stickers on which is a real shame because this could have been a great addition to the mcu i hope they learn something from this but from what ive heard it appears that marvel actually plans to escalate the identity politics in the next phase which would be an absolute disaster for them when pointing to the box office as a defense for how good captain marvel was just remember that tons of paying customers didnt like it at all", "a fine example of political correctness dull and disappointing please dont waste your time and money ps if you looking for a real female superhero i recommend wonder woman or alita", "blaahhhhh total waste of time boring can i get a refund the worst movie of the mcu so far and that includes the reboot of the fantastic four save your cash and time wait a couple of weeks and stream it for free still not worth doing that either boring", "i ignored the drama behind this movie and went and seen it anyway worst decision i couldve made brie larson isnt too bad of an actress and the rest of the cast is pretty good also the problem is the writing the entire movie felt like a filler catered to children except i dont know how even a child couldve been entertained by this there was almost no action which is fine if theres a decent story or plot building up except there wasnt you just have captain marvels bland facial expression and no emotion which may have been what they were going for but it just didnt work because it made the movie even more boring this is supposed to be captain marvel i was hyped to finally see captain marvel getting a movie but jesus what a disappointing trainwreck", "if i was donald trump i would send this film back right where it came from and have them actually put some serious effort on it it has got to be the worst mcu film in the history of mcu films unbelievably stupi", "this movie feels out of place in the mcu it feels fury is not the same character we meet only 10 years later the movie tries to force us to like brie larson not carol danvers or captain marvel the character feels like a mix between tony stark thor and feminist captain america to make things worse at the end she is way to op however the movie had some good jokes it was not over preachy sure there where some cringe moments but all in all it could be worse the best part of this movie is the 90s nostalgia ben medelsohn fury&goose and the kree but the kree do not get that much screen time they feel like the warriors 3 with even less to do the intro does gave me shivers what a tribute to stan lee i would say captain marvel is solo a star wars story mixed with the incredible hulk a fun popcorn movie but nothing more", "i heard about the bad reviews before seeing captain marvel but figured from all the reviews saying its people slayting on it cause shes a women which didnt make sense as this isnt the first movie weve had a women in the lead role and as a superhero eg wonder womenalita and ghost in a shell to name a few i went in there with the mind set it may not be great but good enoughwell memy wife and sister all thought the samethis is rubbishthe whole time i was waiting to get pulled into the story and get excited to see her use her powers and fly but you sort of see her powers straight awayminus the flying and when you do see it its nothing like a wow moment you find out how she gets her powers near the middle end so most of the film your just wondering how she got them and when you find out your like oh right ok was that it i just felt like it had lots missing to iti didnt really care much about heri was never really woried or felt much toward her like i did for wonder women or any of the avengersi think the actress who played captain marvel was very woden and not a very good actressscarlet johanson played her part really well in the avengers so hopefully she can get some tips of heri was just really disappointed that this is the hero whos supposed to save the day in endgamei thought her powers were not amazing and felt like when she used them they didnt really do muchunless your a juxbox or door tbh if your seeing this to the up to endgame you dont need tohas nothing in it that ties to endgame apart from the credit scene which you can get on youtube and tbh it wasnt all thatif you wondering how fury gets the pager*little spoiler*********** ******************she gives it to him after he hands it to her earlier in the film but this time she modified it to call her overall id say it reminded me of a netflix marvel show id say it was watchable but nothing moreannoyed at myself for sticking up for it before i saw it and now i actually want my money back", "disney i ask you please please please stop the social justice warrior swj centered movies you are pumping out when you set political agenda in entertainment it detracts from the story you have historically been the best movie studio and until recently you focused on telling great stories rather than pushing an agenda now you have ruined the star wars universe and are heading towards ruining the mcu never though it would be possible with a political agenda please come back to the middle and tell stories based upon great storylines i dont care if the main characters are black white yellow green female male gay straight just tell a compelling well written story and leave the politics to the politicians do we have to boycott your movies to get you to see the light i would rather send that message right now rather than let this crap bleed out over the next 5 years and let you ruin cherished and loved franchises that we all grew up with wonder woman was one of my favorite movies over the past 5 years no agenda and yes a leading female roll game set match for dc comics for leaving politics out of the movies cant wait to see what they come out with next aquaman was great tooplease hear the fans cries you are slowly losing us", "bad acting bad script bad directing just bad overall seemed like i was watching some cliche movie made by a freshman in college with way too much money but not enough skills to pull it off", "felt like the movie was more targeted as a feminist anti culture than a good marvel movie it portrayed that women are weak and must overcome difficulty the movie only portray difficulties from men in order to become strong it also shows that in order to become truly strong one must give in to emotions again portraying men as logical beings and women as emotional they even went so far as to use music with male lead singers for the villain only while the protagonist only had music from female lead singers i only enjoyed the movie for its back story to fury the only

and overflowing genius comedic dialogue which just shines every look every gesture every note from the rock kevin hart and jack black are perfection in that at no time do you doubt they are who they

member _if you allow yourself to be_ you will be swept up and transported by itso why any low ratingswhile the first jumanji was fun underneath the fun there were dark layers there is none of that here and perhaps this is where some of the disconnect from its detractors comes from unlike the original jumanji jumanji welcome to the jungle is a fun and funny film throughout in closing quite to the contrary of what a couple of reviewers are saying about robin williams such as hed be rolling over in his grave over this movie robin williams was one of those rare and amazingly special individuals who found joy and humor in most everything and who chose to share that with those of us who are lucky enough to be witness to some of the favorites he left behind personally i find it in very bad taste and verging on offensive that those who seem to not share the capacity to laugh or live the way he did or the ability to laugh with the rest of us and who lack the gift of both being able to give or receive the very humor which exuded from mr williams would dare say he would be doing anything other than laughing riotously while munching on some popcorn and watching this filmthank you robin williams for the precursor which was so fantastic it brought about an equally wonderful sequelyou are missed", "i used to have an imdb account when i was a teen   or at least thought i did but couldnt log on in any case i think ive visited here maybe twice in the last five years today though after just getting back from watching this with my almost grown kids i had to make an account just to leave this reviewto begin ill never understand people i cant believe the negative reviews how could anyone not have laughed like hell while watching this and still have a pulse i didnt go in expecting much but i came out with a smile on my face the girl is hot jack black owns it ive never been overly enthused about kevin hart but he was fantastic and the rock just knocked it out of the park i saw one review which reads not a wrestling fan ever so to see the rock in movies instantly puts me off does anyone else want to vomit at the inanity irony and ludicrousness of that statement then you have the user who out of 40+ titles he she has reviewed in the past has only ever rated two above three stars seriously if you dont enjoy films and find them so terrible find a new hobby already youve got one guy saying the shirt one of the kids wore was outdated so im guessing one can only wear clothing depicting the current year then you have the reviewers who maybe didnt understand the dialogue since they can barely communicate correctly themselves such gems   i kid you not   as averege what so ever family fair fare are just wasnt due to it has all of there {their coz it is boring story no compare with finally you have the maybe half dozen reviewers who are so caught up in their bigotry that they cant relax and enjoy a film if it isnt whitewashed and who complain about the hollywood liberal agenda of diversity leave the politics at the door man in short jumanji welcome to the jungle was a fantastic hour or more of rip riding fun and laughsexcept for one very funny moment dwayne johnson retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead provides a smoldering and intense performance riddled with good natured hilarity as the lead in this film gillan was great in doctor who and although i thought she was the weakest of both characters and actors in this film she still held her own and looked fantastic doing so she has one of those faces you cant help but love kevin hart was fantastic as the diminutive valet and looking back i think he was somehow involved in every funny moment in which i laughed the hardest finally the master the maestro though i never really was a fan prior to this jack black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection10 10 and definitely a film i will be purchasing right after i click submit you can never have enough laughter in life and jumanji welcome to the jungle delivers barrels full", "we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake the jokes are nonstop and witty characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of jumanji a little homage is paid to alan parrish at the beginning of the movie and the movie continues 20 years after the events of 1996the rock is always fun but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence karen gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl jack black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny kevin hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic all in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor worth the trip to see it on the big screen you do not have to see the original to appreciate it not quite 10 stars because adult re watch value is just not there", "we went to see this as part of the early screening for amazon prime members i always worry that all the funniest parts of a movie are spoiled in the trailer leaving nothing left in the film that isnt the case i was either smiling or

sent to detention where they discover and are consequently sucked into jumanji they become the avatars they chose for the game and must complete the object of the game without using up all their lives they have to work together as a team it is so much fun its predictable funny cute and the most important entertaining the actors are great in it including a few cameos that were unexpected the humor isnt too crude but still slapstick y and funny it was along the vein of shrek rat race or clue again if youre looking for deep and cant stand watching a movie without questioning everything skip this one this is one of those movies ill be buying just so i can put it on and laugh", "we went to see this movie today with the kids and man i had a blast i expected it to be a nice movie but i was so surprised by every single minutejack black is at his best in this kind of comedic roles hes hilarious in this one too dwayne johnson and the rest also give a very entertaining performanceit is so much fun i cannot stop talking about iti did have to force myself to stop thinking about robin williams for emotional reasons this movie is a great tribute to robinyes it does have some continuity problems with the robin williams movie but its forgivable the movie is full of action good humor and special effects youd wish they had back in 1995 with the first moviego see it", "reboots can be tricky while some click most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like jurassic world the mummy kong skull island but much like spiderman homecoming jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers  jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention here they discover the jumanji video game and enter the world of jumanji as their avatars then starts the fun ride there are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from alexs freak house the movie uses time tested cliche   four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when literally seen from some others point of view but the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them at least till the movie endsthe movie does not take itself seriously and that is a huge plus point the plot of the movie is crazy there are man eating albino what rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side but such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself which makes you fall in love with it morethe bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors all of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters parts where dwayne johnsonspencer stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits not to mention his hilarious display of smoldering intensity kevin hart is kevin hart and jack blake as a women in a mans body is perfect karen gillan who is this mean nebula in mcu comes up with a very charming performanceall in all jumanji is a

bone in their bodys low scores but no this movie deserves a 10 and more jumanji welcome to the jungle is a stand alone hilarious romp which leaves the original in the dust heck hilarious is an understatement note that this is not to say that the original jumanji was bad on the contrary it was great especially for when it was filmed and who better than sir robin williams but in terms of laugh out loud good fun and non stop smiles this jumanji far outpaces and outdoes the original while my bf and i have somewhat different tastes in movies and he is not a rock fan he loved him as a wrestler not so much as an actor we both laughed so much while watching this the rock knocks it out of the park with equally stellar performances by jack black and kevin hart what is even more fabulous is that it has kids humor yes but also thinking peoples humor in the form of obscure little tidbits which are dropped here and there and keep you on your toes and grinning ear to ear there is hardly any scene where you step out of the roller coaster ride of fun it sets you on from the moment they and you are in jumanjido yourself a favor watch this and if you dont laugh raucously at least six times seriously consider what else might be wrong in fact if you read through some of the negative comments you see the same old bored stagnant people complaining about it being too pc and blah blah blah cry me a river if you notice these peoples other reviews it is easy to see that anything that they consider too scary read progressive to fit in the mold of their little minds and world automatically gets relegated to the 1 10 pile shamein closing this jumanji gained a place within my favorite movies of all time and the only thing which makes me sad about it is that 1 i wonder if upon a fourth viewing we saw it three times through my 20th it will lose some of its luster and 2 that it wasnt much much longer as i did not want the fun to end", "i would watch this movie two more times at least this was a very funny movie arguably one of the best performance jack black has done when i watched this with my family in a packed movie theatre i kid you not the entire cinema was laughing during quite a few of the scenes the humour is excellently tailored to the audience and is a beautiful tribute to the original jumanji with robin williams the way it fantastically coincides with the original movie and moves onto a sort of sequel to this is beautiful and a rare thing these days the movie is very funny and easily one of the greatest movies to have come out this year it is certainly in the top 15 movies that have come out post 2010 accompanied with the likes of guardians of the galaxy deadpool and now the recent movie that just came out bright if you felt that bright was also under appreciated by movie critics the exact same thing has happened here as jumanji is a 100% gaurantee a movie that will be appreciated after watching personally i would watch it again and again with people it is not just a movie to watch and discard this is one to put on the bookshelf and watch again in the future loved it thank you for such a great movie with a fantastic and fun cast who clearly have great chemistry on and off the screen", "all of the performers are fantastic in this film and are perfect fits for their roles the group dynamics are excellent and they all have hilarious back and forths with each other some of my favorite moments in the movie are when everyone is simply standing around talking dwayne johnson really shows his comedic talents here while he does have a few scenes where he gets to show off his action chops most of his role is comedy heavy and he delivers on it kevin hart plays the same character he always plays and more times than not it annoys me but for whatever reason here it works maybe its his chemistry with the other actors but hes hysterical in this movie im not a huge fan of karen gillans character of nebula in the guardians of the galaxy films so i wasnt sure how she was going to be in this but she delivers as well not only does she nail the action beats and she has some of the best in the whole movie but she also has some great comedic moments comedy that i didnt know she could pull off as well as she did but the true star of this movie is jack black i thought he was hysterical in the trailer but i was afraid that the concept of him actually being a teenage girl would get old and annoying quick but it doesnt black is perfect for this role and nails every comedic moment hes given they are all fantastic together and it makes for some great entertainment", "jumanji 1995 has many memorial moments for example the reveal of the jumanji board monkeys robbing a police car the stampede sinking floors the flooded room with some crocodiles the incredible use of the sound track basically a lot of stuff the original is well crafted and now its 2017 and we have jumanji welcome to the jungle its a fun action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me its not jumanji as robin williams said ive seen things youve only seen in your nightmares but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display dwayne johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy kevin hart plays himself nothing new karen gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is jack black playing as a teenage girl named bethany everything jack says is incredibly funny and will leave you falling off your seat like i said before its not jumanji 65 10", "when i first heard they were making a reboot of jumanji i was skeptical these days it seems like everything is getting a half assed reboot or spinoff so when i went in to watch this movie i didnt expect anything life changing or original and i was shocked with the results this story was actually good it took the original concept that was jumanji and made its own twists and turns and didnt actually butcher the original source and i really enjoyed all the characters as well which is something i couldnt exactly say about the original film i was so surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie that honestly i find myself wanting to go back and re watch it when it comes to movies starring comedians i dont really get very hopeful about the content and quality of the movie especially these days when comedians turn out to mostly rely upon profanities and slap stick more than wit and actual humor however the jokes in this movie were on point and i really enjoyed kevin harts performance as well as dwayne johnsons they played well off one another and it wasnt over the top and wow i really did think jack black had hit the high point of his career back in kung fu panda and was on the down slope but he was easily one of the best parts of this movie the casting for this movie was great overall   not only that but this movie was more than the typical comedy movies you see nowadays that are all about getting drunk spitting out as many curse words in a sentence as possible being shocking there was a serious plot behind it with actual stakes and it played its serious moments very well all of the characters went through important evolutions that were believable by the end of the film now it wasnt perfect there are things that were a bit off in terms of continuity and if you know the first jumanji then you might see where im getting at but it wasnt enough to take away from the film itself overall this was a very enjoyable movie and id definitely watch it again the movie was a tasteful update to the jumanji franchise and to be honest id love to see if they have plans for a sequel id certainly watch it given how well they treated this moviethen again i did watch pitch perfect 3 in the same night as this one so this positive review might be a little biased when taking in both movies side by side in a short period of time", "fun movie for family silly at times with decent action and interesting people if you are a guy wanting to bring wife girlfriend to movie youll both walk out feeling you got your moneys worth then this is a great pick it wont win any fancy awards but best movie in theaters right now", "the original jumanji was supposed to be a one and done film even though it teased the potential for a sequel many voiced trepidation at the prospect of a sequel after all these years later and after the tragic death of original star robin williams there were valid concerns about whether this sequel could be both a good movie and a fitting sequel and tribute to what had come beforei am glad to report that it fulfilled all expectationsthe film relies almost entirely on its star power and it has that in spades with the likes of dwayne johnson kevin hart jack black karen gillan and nick jonas where the charm resides though is the actors playing against their types through the means of real world to video game body switching the rock embodying a nerdy hypochondriac hart an all star jock gillan a shy insecure reject and perhaps most brilliant of them all black housing a shes all that pretty girl together our four teenage protagonists get sucked into the video game incarnation of jumanji a jungle land that is threatened from the typical video game threat and our heroes must do the usual video game tasks in order to beat the game and return to the real world all without getting killed in game which will get them killed in real life after three livesthe film thematically treads the same sort of ground that other teen movies tend to cover mainly the stereotypical high school tropes get thrust into a situation that forces them to work together to correct each others flaws and by the end they return to their normal lives as better peoplewhat the film does different in the body switching is that these tropes are transferred onto adult actors people who each have tropes of their own and the way that each actor gets to play against their type is definitely what makes this movie so funon the flipside like a video game the villain is very one  dimensional and while the narrative isnt necessarily harmed by it it does stand out as something thats lacking wishing that the villain was more than just i will kill you because reasonsalso the character introductions in the real world at the beginning of the film feel very forced as in we all know they end up in the game and the reasons they get into the situation feel very convenient as if the writers could not find an elegant means to get these four people in the same place in front of the game console at the same time so they just threw them all togetherthese are fairly minor nitpicks as the pace of this film is fast it doesnt really drag at all and while they do repeat a joke or two it doesnt step over the line into annoying all this makes for a very fun film definitely worth your time this holiday season and after once it gets released on home media", "i actually come to watch this movie with low expectation i watched 1st jumanji and it was really great and i watched it a couple times the sequel is a little different with its successor with the theme is still same a game that involved real adventures to its player four teenagers sucked into the game and they become a character they chose which is very different from their real life the movie is so funny and if you played rpgs game you will find this really entertaining the humour is still suitable for young audiences so its a family movie too and while its a humour adventures movie it still have a good message so i really recommend it hope youll enjoy it too", "really enjoyable movie the movie is well paced great cast great action sequences i think this is a must see movie for all the family", "heard about another jumanji film being made but thought it was going to be a remake of sorts well through years of development it seems to be more of a different take on the 1995 classic and a good take it wasstarting at 1996 a young man finds a board game on the beach after hearing the iconic jungle drums sound emitting from the box partially covered in sand like the original he finds it takes it home with him & then finds out its an nintendo like game & plugs it into his console & starts playing he gets sucked in & is trapped in the game similar to the original but as a computer games console not a board game interesting takeso fast forward 21 years later & 4 young teens who all come together via detention play the game & get sucked in after finding it in a store room in the school its then they find themselves in different bodies & each have 3 lives like that of a computer console game they then learn of the curse of the jungle via a green jewel & must place it back where it was & shout jumanjithe film i thought was pretty good of course it wouldnt be nearly as good as its counter back in 95 but its pretty damn close to be an original & somewhat is the story was simple & easy to follow the characters were great & likable karen gillan was a babe in this film sorry had to say it but she & the others were great i also liked the humour in this film too it was funny & fitted welli was kind of peeved it wasnt set in the real world as appose to a jungle but i suppose it was because they were sucked into a different world so it made sense in a way & it wasnt too bad eitheroverall this film was a good watch & matches pretty well with the original film 9 10 go watch it", "i was skeptical at first but found myself in full belly laugh within the first few minutes cool idea amazing actors unique story arc on the jumanji name and its a family movie too despite a few words from kevin hart i recommend", "four high school kids discover an old video game console and are drawn into the games jungle setting literally becoming the adult avatars they chose what they discover is that you dont just play jumanji   you must survive it to beat the game and return to the real world theyll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives discover what alan parrish left 20 years ago and change the way they think about themselves   or theyll be stuck in the game forever", "ill start out by saying that my family is a really big fan of the robin williams bonnie hunt jumanji movie i personally thought it was alright nothing great but not bad either i went into this movie with my doubts about its quality one because i wasnt the biggest fan of the original and two because i was fearful it would just be another generic action romp i was wrong this is one of the best action films ive seen in some time and there are many reasons as to why this one works so well reason number one the casting this cast is just perfectly put together dwayne the rock johnson really was great in the lead role one of his best performances in my opinion kevin hart serves as the ever hilarious comedic relief and he did a fabulous job of making the audience laugh their asses off jack black is really great here as well very funny really the best middle aged man in hollywood you could pick to play as a teenage girl stuck in another body and lastly karen gillan and nick jonas give fun entertaining performances the acting is a big plus for this movie reason number two the writing the script allows for many things comedy action and some serious stuff too funny lines for the comedic heavyweights and more touching sweet content for when its called for and finally reason number three very exciting action and effects the action scenes are done well and achieve the level of excitement that they are going for and the visual effects are top of the line as well overall this is just a great film overall and it even gave a small harken back to the original 90s film great lovable characters exciting action skilled writing just a joy overall 9 10 for jumanji welcome to the jungle", "using the washroom after viewing this movie had me more on the edge of my seat than the film itself average cinematography the characters were stereotypical and boring the plot was highly predictable and trite as in there was no part of the entire movie that caught me off guard or that i didnt expect and the scenes that were apparently meant to be suspenseful or exciting were not the film was full of cheesy forced dialogue and pointless romantic subplots one of my biggest pet peeves in action adventure movies it did have a few funny moments which is just about the only thing that made me give it higher than a 1 10 ratingits not the worst thing ive seen in my life and to be fair i dont usually watch this genre of movie it was the one my cousin wanted to see but around halfway through i definitely was bored and looking forward to the end in hindsight i wouldnt have spent $10 and two hours on this its probably an all right family movie or an appealing plot for a 12 year old but for me it was a total yawn", "i think the concept of how teenagers get transported into seasoned actors in a different world is something new to me i really enjoyed the humor and the way the story flows my wife and i enjoyed the movie thoroughly and we left the show feeling satisfied", "dwayne johnson just keeps getting better with age jack black and kevin hart are very talented actors who know how to temper their roles just enough to compliment the movie enjoyed this movie with all the action unpredicatability and creative direction and scenes high recommend", "with robin williams rip a young kirsten dunst bonnie hunt and others  they had a nice notion of making a comedic espect of it using body swap the big muscular in the game is actually a weak nerd in real life the popular girl is a middle aged man etc   thats pretty much itlike this game some things should be left alone ", "the original jumanji is a nostalgic film from my childhood it still held up when i rewatched it earlier this month the effects arent the greatest but the film was fun and had a lot of heart i was not one of those annoying people who had pitchforks out when they heard about jumanji being rebooted or getting a sequel always give a film a chance thats what i do after seeing promo pics and trailers i was hyped i like the rock and kevin hart working together and also love karen gillan the film looked like a fresh spin on the original and even looked like an effort that wanted to stand on its own it does exactly that say what you want this is a very fun filmfour different teenagers are given detention and once there they discover an old video game named jumanji they plug the game system in and are sucked into the world of jumanji primarily in a jungle where they must return a jewel into an enormous jaguar statue sounds easy but the jungle is filled with tricks and traps and wild animals oh yeah the four characters become the characters in the game physically this makes for a very entertaining time with almost non stop humor on top of its adventurethe actors do very well in this jack black and kevin hart bring the comedy jack blacks character is actually the embodiment of a self absorbed teenage girl and he plays that remarkably well i dig kevin hart with his loud commentary i also love that hes always getting knocked over thrown around in the way of danger or in this films case  explodes all the humor in this film comes at you tenfold and it all works the story keeps you on the edge of your seat and while somewhat predictable its never boring the action scenes are gripping and grand scale i loved the world of the film and the connection between the charactersthe film has a few nods to the original but the film is still quite independent from the original which is nice really its in name alone the connection to the first overall its a blast at the end of the year its a re watchable and exciting comedy adventure take off your critical lenses and actually sit and enjoy this the negative things im reading about this are analyzing it on such a deep level dude relax and enjoy8 1", "jumanji 2 is a hilarious fun escapist adventure movie starring the rock jack black and kevin hart using video game rules the movie truly brings video game magic to the screen and subtly pokes fun at the action genre the rock is great as usual and has a literally huge presence in the movie the chemistry among the cast is great and the rock proves once again he is the go to guy if hollywood wants to revitalize a franchise though he has yet to prove he can fuel an actual franchise by himself as for jack black and kevin hart both provide great comedy to an already comical the rock however kevin harts character is more interesting than blacks and therefore wins the crown for best comical character in the movie karen gillan is stunning and kicks ass though she is not given much else to do the movie has great sweeping shots and over the top action but all of this makes the movie plausible given the premise that the characters are trapped in a game world recommended for all to watc"], "sentiment": 0.18927041319039542, "tmdb_review":
