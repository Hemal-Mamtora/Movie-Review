{"movie": [{"movie_name": "deadpool", "review": ["i really really liked deadpool and you know what i didnt expect to seriously i was never a fan of the character in the sense that i hardly knew anything about him and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers still i remained interested in the film i just never expected it to actually be good   until the reviews arrived after most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise i went in cautiously optimistic but still fully prepared to hate the filmthe first thing i noticed was how inventive the storytelling is the film throws you into the action from the first moment literally the very first moment and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane   but oddly charming   antihero flashbacks and fast forwards can be annoying as hell but when done right they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting and thats exactly how deadpool felt to me right from the start like a fresh if somewhat dirty jolt of energythe action itself is beautifully designed employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection but and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much theres a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly ryan reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co star morena baccarin what came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic deadpool is the love story in this film is probably the most sincere ive ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lackthe humor which i initially feared would just be non stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting also works surprisingly well not every line or every joke lands   but thats the beauty of this character they dont really need to deadpool cant help himself as long as hes able to breathe hell crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him its a clinical condition hes not a stand up comedian whose jokes need to land hes a madman albeit a very entertaining one and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedydespite all my praise its not a perfect film the villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist he insists hes not a hero justice but its a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequels and its actually a very important film for another reason if deadpool is a financial success   which at this point is already clear it will be   this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of r rated superhero films and well hopefully see more of them in the futuremany people might feel different   and i respect their opinion   but ive grown tired of the entirely bloodless cgi overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like mormon schoolgirls i mean theres a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18 loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real world language real world sex and real world violence in superhero movies this genre is so diverse its ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations   regardless of the material   must automatically be made for kids in order to be successfulas it is i think deadpool   a dirty funny sexy and violent film which is decidedly not for kids   just proved my point perfectly 8 stars out of 10", "deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference little credit should be given to 20th century fox as they had zero faith in the success of a deadpool movie to put things into perspective ryan reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when blade trinity was released reynolds and co went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by reynolds because fox had no intentions to release it to the public finally after years and years of begging to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public fox didnt even tell reynolds and co that the film was greenlit they had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians if that sounds bad fox even cut their budget by $7 million at the last minute which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that im sure wouldve been great to seedeadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of february surpassing fifty shades of grey the biggest opening weekend for 20th century fox surpassing all the x men films and the biggest opening weekend for an r rated film ever surpassing the matrix reloaded with all that being said deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of reynolds himself his comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed of course credit should be given to the writers too aka the real heroes here and its impressive that this is tim millers directorial debut the action sequences and pacing are so good that youd think this came from a veteran directorfrom the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending deadpool constantly upends clich\u00e9s and tropes youre used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years whats great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it jokes about pedophilia pegging and sex run rampant but its never really dark despite the mature subject matter on top of that its also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film its unheard of these days fox and other studios learn from this success its not the fact that a hard r rated film can do well its that deadpool also happens to be very good most likely because you fox actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted", "at first glance deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by marvel but once those hilarious intro credits show up you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years the first thing that is unique about this film is the characters in typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious in deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious francis to the silly deadpool giving this a parody like feel in a good wayalso what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city world universe that is seen in every single superhero film also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly this film just does not stop the laughs i laughed 20  30 times in my second watch as for being an origin story i can say that the backstory placements were well done equally as funny and explains only what is important in understanding the story final rating 10 10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever mad", "deadpool is a very fun movie after the characterization of deadpool i saw in x men origins wolverine i never wanted a deadpool movie i got one it didnt disappoint but at the same time i feel it is one of the most over praised movies of all times i dont hate this movie at all but at the same time i dont like it either the majority of it is entertaining what works first and foremost the character   deadpool this hilarious and goofy badass merc with a mouth is something i really liked his jokes punchlines and fourthwall breaking humor lands perfectly secondly the non linear storytelling if this movie had a linear storytelling it wouldnt have been half as entertaining as it is thirdly the hilarious character moments and slapstick comedy the character interaction between deadpool and some of the x men and francis and dopinder and negasonic are funny and entertaining   sometimes involving some slapsticky things which are grose and graphic but solely due to deadpools mutation makes it funny the fourth wall break   take this element out the movie is totally incomplete action scenes   pretty good especially the first one but thats all i liked about it what bothered a lot of things it takes too much of liberty due to the fourth wall breaking elements it has it uses a number of movie clich\u00e9s of the superhero genre and mock them by breaking the fourth wall that surely is hilarious but doesnt change the fact that the movie had a lazy writing also the plot is a typical superhero origins stuff a little more romantic though none of the plotlines were exciting or intriguing it felt good just because of the way the character deadpool was written else every one of them were simply clich\u00e9d materials it felt as if we had to accept whatever was shoved down our throats and we had all the fourth wall breaks to cover it up that felt like an overconfidence in the part of the makers also one particular scene involving deadpool and the villain feels too stretched if it wasnt there we wont have a third act why are people intentionally looking over these i am completely surprised to see a bunch of people saying this is the greatest superhero film ever it isnt bad and doesnt suck thats all i can name a whole lot of superhero movies much better than this   the dark knight 2008 spider man 2002  spider man 2 2004 logan 2017 avengers infinity war 2018 deadpool 2 2018 captain america civil war 2016 x men first class 2011 x men days of future past 2014 x men 2000 batman begins 2005 the dark knight rises 2012 unbreakable 2000 the avengers 2012 wonder woman 2017 x2 x men united 2003 thor ragnarok 2017 etc so i absolutely dont feel that it being called the greatest superhero film is apt in the end it is essential to say that ryan reynolds is absolutely great as wade wilson deadpool no one should replace him as deadpoolscore  63 10grade  b label  entertaining for single or occasional view", "if anyone else could be cast to play deadpool he certainly doesnt exist in this universe after ryan reynoldss dramatic failure in the green lantern film he has returned to the comic book world reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed and witty anti hero i mean he is just superb he completely owns the role and gives a fantastic performance if robert downey jr is iron man then ryan reynolds is deadpool he is also such a liveable character and by the end of the film i genuinely cared about deadpool i never thought id say that all of the performances are great no one holds a candle to reynolds but i will say not one person was miscast heredeadpool is a unique film and a huge gamble both marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk this is a beloved character and his world is very different than other marvel films right off the bat this film is consciously self aware it knows its a comic book film with comic book characters and it actually exploits it many times deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what were all thinking it was so different and it worked so very well the narrative itself is also different its very non linear the events of the film dont play out in a normal straight narrativeone of the trademarks nay the trademark of deadpool is his sense of humour this film is by far one of the most hysterical films i have seen in some time the writing is so perfect so sharp and so full of witty banter and thankfully it all works not one joke that i remember fell flat the film had me laughing constantly from the opening credits all the way to the after credits sceneas for the action its also very satisfying many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work for whatever reason many modern action films are using shaky cam instead of clear steady shots the dp will go hand held and shake the camera violently the worst example in recent memory of this is taken 3 thankfully there are films like this and others that know exactly how to do a good action scene director tim miller and cinematographer ken seng do a brilliant job creating slick good looking action not only is the action brutal and extremely bloody its just co clear and well handled the fights are really great here i couldnt help but be reminded of tarantinos kill bill films while watching deadpool they are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenessitting in the cinema the inner critic in me struggled internally i kept thinking afterwards about the film what were the flaws i dont often see a film without pointing out the negatives even films i really like or even love have flaws im certain that if one sits and picks this apart you will eventually find some flaws perhaps the overall story is paper thin perhaps the villain wasnt very compelling as character then again ajax was honestly serviceable ed skrein gave a great performance and by the end you really hate the bastard hes a generic or a dick british villain and the film makes fun of thatdeadpool and guardians of the galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off big time as a film its nearly perfect the film does exactly what it needed to do and more it introduces deadpool sets up his character and gets you to like him if you didnt already the non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film everything about this film was different and unique its self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well really well the direction is great ryan reynolds is phenomenal and the script is fantastic", "i am aware that to many people especially those unfamiliar with deadpool comic or marvel comics at all this movie would seem too gory unnecessary brutal and excessively violent but this movie is a comedy where its main protagonist deadpool should be perceived as a comedian and ryan reynolds did an excellent job representing this characterthe story of deadpool isnt complex or profound   and it wasnt meant to be this movie is all about fun and entertainment abundant with action jokes blood and foul language therefore it is not suitable for children i grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children onlyrelated to that i believe that many marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didnt refrain from gory scenes i am sorry but if you want to make a serious combat based movie and you make it without blood than that movie will be all but seriousthat is why i see deadpool as a refreshment nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies that really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realizationthus to me deadpool was a very pleasant surprise i had fun watching it and i intend to watch it again some time soon", "firstly i would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with one star because the movie had foul language and sex scenes or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid dead pool is rated r and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not with that being said i will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic ryan reynolds nailed this role if you are easily offended by violence language or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie", "ive said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect there arent any movies that actually deserve a perfect score but what if you were a dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too and had already played the character once with horrible results wished for redemption what if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise above the whole pg 13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into these days what character would be completely drowned in such a pool wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton though he did finally get unleashed with an r rated send off film possibly partly thanks to this movie but deadpool could never have been done right in a pg 13 movie the merc with the mouth had to have his lips sowed shut the first go round and after that well most fans would say he was never truly deadpool including the man who played himryan reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of playing a real deadpool and boy does he the r rating took the comic book genre to a sparkly place i wish it would have gone to years ago oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and reynolds nails it possibly thanks to the fact that he actually caredbut how good is it as a movie aside from all that well i gave it a ten it might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasnt so special it was the first r rated movie of its kind and it proved to the people and the studios that it could be extremely successful even with that rating thank you deadpool you deserve an extra star for that alone", "deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the x men franchise where the merc with the mouth seeks revenge in a humorous waywade wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in new york

and they reconcile by kissingin a post credits scene deadpool urges the audience to leave and go home then announces that there will be a sequel involving cable", "let me say at the very beginning of this review i loathe super hero movies i can not stress that point enough for me watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is for me akin to having teeth pulled painful to say the least my friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise and through sufferance ive endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more lycra clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat there are of course exceptions to the above the dark knight the original x meni was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching deadpool would be an excellent waste of my time i envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping well that new morphy richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold shock of all shocks this film is bloody marvellous bloody hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off marvellousthe dialogue is witty sincere and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius than drab scripted nonsensethe pacing of the movie is excellent it held my interest through its entiretythe actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned directori was so pleased that for once i was being forced to watch a movie that treated me like an adult with adult humour and themes made for adults not for grown children masquerading as adultsthis film is a perfect storm just everything is right i look forward to my great surprise to any squeals", "in a world where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty #deadpool comes along and shows you how its done its the perfect combo of action comedy and r rating that really dont give two sh*ts about your sensitivity do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl youve been crushing on during chemistry class in high school well you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for deadpoolryan reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary wade wilson morena baccarin plays his hot ass girlfriend vanessa this woman is the embodiment of sexy they are a match made in marvel comics heaven but their dream is crushed upon discovering that wilson has cancer all over a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers the lab is run by francis ajax ed skrein who himself is a bit of a mutant the brutal experiments turn wade wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one hes now bent on revenge especially after ajax kidnaps vanessa meanwhile colossus and negasonic teenage warhead from the x men try their best to convince deadpool to join their team and become one of the good guys but lets face it that aint deadpools style the first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writers creators fabian nicieza and rob liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other the next people in line to thank are screenwriters rhett reese and paul wernick who remind us why we loved zombieland back in 2009 they inject the same brand of humor into deadpool and keep the character faithful to the comic books yes by that i mean none of that crap version of wade wilson in x men origins wolverine anymore applause goes to tim miller as well what a helluva feature directorial debut clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out if you just let him run with it its like giving gi joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart great things can happenfor those of you who are not familiar with deadpool just a heads up this movie just like the comics is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex violence and humor and thats exactly how we like it wade wilson is a chatterbox he talks a lot to some this can get annoying while to the rest its music to our ears mainly because of the sh*t he says and he breaks fourth wall meaning hell talk to you the audience but whats even more epic than that is the fact that he is aware of the universe that hes in and the universe that youre in and those two collide in the most epic way possible so ryan reynolds character wade wilson makes fun of ryan reynolds the actor and also mocks ryan reynolds previous poor decisions like green lantern and people magazines sexiest man alive this movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans it even has what i think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema for a while i heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants but im glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment aka origin story so its simple enough for the new fans to follow i love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic its like insult comedy or one of them roast shows everybody is fair game the fights are rock em sock em and the vfx is impressive and i cant be happier for ryan reynolds im sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since green lantern and whatever the hell that was in x men origins wolverine so with this deadpool movie he finally got it right you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre and so now hes really part of the gang he was born for this role he was destined to play this in many ways deadpool is kinda like van wilder on crack and actress morena baccarin as vanessa\u0085 well lets just say that after watching this movie every guy on earth will wonder why cant my girlfriend be more like that if youre looking for a date movie deadpool is it if youre looking for an action packed movie deadpool is definitely most certainly it", "one word describes this movie   pointlesswow this film was incredibly boring people are hyping this movie over nothing the story is so simple and boring it didnt even feel like i was watching a thought provoking movie more like a short and simple tv series with an unfunny forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains the x men were pointless as well they didnt add anything to the story they only assisted deadpool with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have deadpool work for them they happily accepted deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them the only okay point in this movie was the action however the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography it didnt feel intense at all more like you know the villains are going to fail very easilyi also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program eg superheroes superslaves etc what are these villains even doing there was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains the story was lacking in too many ways the world felt very empty and hollowlooks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is r rated that is the truth that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of f words and other vulgar words it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent none of this is new again the story and characters are terrible", "if you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you every other line contains the f word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest aroundthe story is about as hollow as the humor its a cheap and bland story about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of love that is as misguided as the characters personalitythe movie is littered with sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a whileryan reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie cursing and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is very funny this is the most overrated movie ive seen most of these reviews on imdb had to have been paid for hollywood had to have paid for this hype or people these days have really low standards this is a low brow film like no othersave 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie", "with a brilliant script visceral action and a oscar worthy performance by lead ryan reynolds 2016s deadpool takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offerproof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor bloody and intense violence as well as a excellent cast and script deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole", "the long awaited deadpool is finally and with its much talked about hard r rating starring ryan reynolds as a quick taking fourth  wall breaking insult throwing masked superhero we hear about how deadpool became deadpool told in flashback sequences while simultaneously following a present day plot as well the question for the average movie goer is is this film really as good and as raunchy as everyone says no it isnt i dont mean to ramble much so ill start with the good this film does have some humorous moments and most of the supporting characters are very entertaining to watch and yes this film also does have some good action sequencessadly that is where the good ends this films tries very hard to be edgy and raunchy as well as claiming to not be your average marvel film because of those following reasons but let me assure you this film is most definitely very similar to all of the other marvel films by saying fuck a few times showing breasts at a strip club and throwing childish insults such as dicktits is not smart filmmaking or screen writing it is easy adolescent humor this film has a simple plot that is easy to follow and is spoonfed to you i have seen good comedies and i have seen good superhero films and this excels in neither in this films defense it may not try to be anything other than feel  good fun turn your brain off type film but that within itself is lazy filmmaking i shouldnt have to turn my brain off to have enjoy a film", "first off i do not read comics so i do not know the source material i am not a fan boy of marvel or dc i just want to see entertaining movies i may be in the minority at least during its first week of being in theaters but i wanted to write a review to warn others what deadpool is likethe movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially i am fine with low brow humor when it is funny the writers just seem to have reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny i think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes there is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor it is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumbthe plot is nothing more than a simple background origins story and it is run of the mill the movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative the movie is very similar to super and the kick ass movies however those movies were superior to deadpool on every level imo the movie also reminds me of the vacation remake the 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funnythis movie may just be better for younger audiences but i still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source materiali give it a 2 out of 10 it gets an 2 instead of 1 only because morena baccarin was a side character she did the best she could with the limited materialdea", "ryan reynolds is the embodiment of the deadpool character he did an absolutely awesome job and made the movie as epic as it is in my opinion his sense of humour perfectly matches that of the original character before watching the movie i was a bit afraid the story of wade would slowdown the roller coaster ride bit it is nicely scattered throughout the movie not so much to lose track of the original storyline and not too little to be oblivious of where the superhero comes from i think i would have enjoyed it a bit more if more of the marvel universe was pulled into the story but im not completely sure of it  the fourth wall being broken here and there is very refreshing and very deadpool", "based on the marvel comics character of the same name it is the eighth installment in the x men film series it follows wade wilson who after being subjected to an experiment that leaves him with new abilities hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his lifefrom the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time comes deadpool it may not have been the superhero that hollywood wanted but hes certainly the one they deserve after years of speculation as to whether or not everyones favourite anti superhero would actually get made into a standalone picture tim millers deadpool has arrived do not let the february release date fool you this is very much the film that both fans of the character and ryan reynolds have been waiting for full of comedic snark and constant fourth wall breaks and inception style fourth wall breaks within those it delivers every bit upon its promise a truly entertaining ride from start to finish minutes into opening credits you are gracefully dropped into the self aware world of the film with notable credits such as directed by an overpaid tool and produced by *beep*hats if that does not sell you on what kind of comedy deadpool brings to the table then you can always catch a screening of zoolander 2 next door when it comes down to it deadpool is one part vendetta film one part romantic tale a la beauty and the beast style this is the role that ryan reynolds were born to play its been a passion project for the actor for many years and it shows he is to the deadpool franchise the sequel were already planned ahead of its release what robert downey jr is to iron man you cannot imagine anyone else possibly playing the role erased from memory is the x men origins wolverine version that reynolds played in 2009 what a relief the tie in to the world of x men is somewhat limited aside from the inclusion of colossus and negasonic teenage warhead i will not saying more at the end of the day deadpools re watch factor is sky high possibly the most important success of them all im touching myself tonight", "out of all marvel movies made deadpool was the worst the main character talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes the jokes were not funny the scene transition between flashbacks and present conditions were not well donethey tried to put in 2 x men character in the worst possible way it really shows that the studio had no budget for many characters but instead they invested a lot in the slow motion special effect which was coolin terms of story line theres no story theres no character building as well for about 2 hours all you can do is endure the horrible blabber mouth of the main character not funny and irritate the eari wonder how many people did the studio pay to write in good reviews in this websiteworst marvel movie ever", "if ive to keep it short   the movie is really really badthere are plenty of jokes plenty even when yo dont want one these jokes are true to deadpool but thats it they are the jokes deadpool would crack but most of the time they missed the mark and were not even remotely funnytheres absolutely no story in the movie none at all on top of that if youve watched all the trailers watching movie is worthless the entire story is   ajax converted wade into deadpool deadpool searched him to fix his face and once its cleared that ajax is not going to do that deadpool killed him yeah entire 10 minutes stretched into a almost 2 hour movie on top of that for some reason ajax kidnaps pools girlfriend and sets target on his back it makes no senseapart from jokes deadpool also has inner voice but not in this movie hes most of the time blabbering to himself because of that making it much more unfunnythere cannot be much said about the movie as its just extended trailer done badly", "this movie is a huge disappointment and a waste of money and time the jokes are stupid and i realize that deadpool is not what it was cracked up to be too bad as i usually love the marvel movies it seems forced and the jokes actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level more adolescent bathroom style humor the story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes at times i thought to walk out but kept hoping that there would be a redeeming aspect as many of the reviews were positive i kept hoping this movie is more about money making hype with its non existent story plot and childish humor with no depth a huge disappointment", "barney the dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie yeah sure when he cracks one or two jokes its funny but my gosh he would go on and on  regarding the sexual scenes of the movie if one wants to watch porn theyd watch porn i dont know which woman enjoys a man that talks from beginning to end  even during sex he is cracking lame jokes cant get any more ridiculous than that  as for the storyline  couldnt they add a little more detail its like they thought making him blabber

get go funny irreverent and self aware marvel appears to have adopted a doctrine of making their films be entertaining imagine that above any other concerns and deadpool seems to be a culmination of that philosophy it is a testament to the skill and commitment of marvel and the makers that they can get so much mileage out of one second tier character and half the budget than other companies can with four first rate ones fantastic or otherwise way to redeem yourself 20th century fox not bad for a character that was a created as a joke for the non initiated deadpool started life as a blatant clone of deathstroke a character from dc comics marvels main competitorin all this the film is aided in great part by a crackling script that never lets up whereas too many action movies treat the scenes between set pieces as filler packed with exposition and the occasional comic relief deadpool deftly weaves between wise  cracking slapstick violent acrobatics and scenes of serious peril with effortless ease the result of all of this is a movie that is engaging throughout whether featuring profane brilliant banter or graphical bloody shootouts for the film wears that r rating proudly with enough sex and violent to make paul verhoeven get all misty eyed it is not surprise there is already a sequel in the worksanother revelation here is reynolds himself who in deadpool seems to have found his iron man a character so indelibly linked to the actor that plays him that you cannot imagine anyone else playing him and his work here acts as vindication of that whole wolverine debacle which we wont mention ever again but the secret ingredient in the deadpool stew is geek heroine morena baccarin who besides being cute as a button brings the acting chops honed in fan favorites like gotham and firefly or even as the darnest adorable reptilian alien ever in the short lived v reboot baccarin has the perfect easy going confidence to match reynolds sardonic bravado and their superb and convincing on screen chemistry provides the impetus for deadpools heroic arcfor despite all the foul language gore and masturbation jokes this is a story that is surprisingly tender it turns out it wasnt just a marketing gimmick and deadpool really is a love story to be sure one with more severed body parts than your average love yarn but a love story nonetheless starting a new franchise is always risky and studios hate taking risks whatever your stance on comic books is the fact remains this movie should not have been this good the writers and director have shown what can be achieved with bold writing and an unapologetic attitude and more importantly that comic book movies need not be made for kids to be enjoyable or indeed successful heres to hoping that trend will continue hopefully hollywood will take noticeparents briefrated r running time 108 minutes on sex and violence plenty of both there is graphic violence of the gratuitous kind people get shot in all kinds of places and i mean their bodies not exotic locations limbs get bloodily cut off a lot of foul language which i dont mind but im not here to judge deadpool and his love interest get into some vigorous

ideas but doesnt really pay them off the biggest twists were both spoiled by the movie itself it could have done a neat bourne identity type story discovering her past but the trailers already told us who she was and in case you missed the trailers the movie shows us in a mind reading flashback they could have done a nice twist about who are the good guys and who are the bad guys but the movie spoils that by showing us characters who were revealed as villains in guardians of the galaxy it could have done a nice fish out of water story but brie larsons performance is completely one note there is no real change in behavior between vers and caroland on a side note the de aging on fury was good but carrying on that technology for that much screen time makes the uncanny valley affect inevitable and it did take me out of the story a few times and coulson looked downright plastic in the stairwell scenei really wanted to like this but i didntps im not a conspiracy theory guy but i have been trying to post this on rotten tomatoes for weeks for some reason it keeps failing to post while there are hundreds of 5 star ratings from accounts that were just created this month and have only reviewed one movie", "just got home from seeing the movie and immediately told all my fellow mcu fans they need to see it then i hop on here and see negative review after negative review and i disagree with most of them feels like i was in a different movie only thing i will agree with was bad is the fact that we dont know of a captain marvel weakness shes insanely overpowered but i mean so is scarlet witch if you think about it scarlet witch could take down any of the avengers if she wanted to and she sorta did in ultron when she was making all of them see their worst fears by the way why has she not done that since that movie but thats besides the point the only weakness scarlet witch has had was her love for vision but that wasnt introduced until later in her story so i dont think its bad that we dont know captain marvels weakness yet this is the mcu she will have more storyline this was just setting up for more to come i actually think brie larsons acting was great we learn very early in the movie that her characters being trained to control her emotions and impulses thats the only thing she knows as she has no prior memories of course shes a little flat because of that but then i find her character builds and develops as now she has the powers to match her confidence and ambition which gives her even more purpose she starts regaining her memories and you can see her unfold as she feels love her old friend and the daughter she stands up against the kree people who she used to trust and shows them shes better off without them she gives the skrulls a chance and ends up fighting for them and giving up her renewed life on earth for them i find her to be a very different character towards the end than she is in the beginning do people keep forgetting that this movie takes place in the 90s this was an early beginning story for both fury and coulson neither of them have gone through any of the crap they soon will so i think its well done that their characters were quite different they will develop with time if you watch this movie then all the other marvel movies in chronological order itd be more clear they also joke that coulson is the new guy which to me explains his slightly timid attitude i went into this movie trying to not let the politics affect my opinion if you go into the movie already with a bad taste in your mouth you might be disappointed and i in no way support some of the things brie larson has said and done but i dont find that any of that was brought into the movie and i am capable of letting those two instances be separate i dont have to love and support every actor actress in a movie in order to love the movie i am a female in my mid 20s and i felt very empowered by this movie my 29 year old brother felt empowered i feel like this movie is intended to be motivational for all audiences and doesnt try to tear anyone down goose was amazing and adorable up until he eats the bad guys that was weird and uncomfortable to me but ok still love goose is it the best marvel has done no but i am overall very pleased with the movie and will be seeing it again and again i just wish it gave us more teasers towards the rest of the avengers and endgame but i guess i can wait another month for that if i have to", "where do i even start with this messlet me start by saying ive been a comic book fan since i was a child i live and breathe marvel and will defend their stories and characters until the day i die ive been able to find something enjoyable in every marvel movie to date until i saw captain marvelthis movie is a huge mess it has a wildly inconsistent tone extremely boring one note characters awful pacing and worst of all an absolute nothing of a main characterbrie larson is so wooden and plain i couldnt take anything she said seriously and any attempt at charisma from her made me cringe for those defending her performance her character has amnesia shes trying to figure out who she is allow me to point you in the direction of the bourne films matt damon plays a character that doesnt know anything about himself and i was firmly invested in his performance from start to finishthis movie insists on telling you how important captain marvel is without doing anything to earn it or demonstrate that to the audienceaside from a boring performance of a boring main character there is the matter of the script that drags down whatever this movie had going for it captain marvel takes itself so seriously but provides nothing by way of tension or stakes it winds up being a completely dull experience which is the worst thing a colourful superhero movie can bethe only thing going for this movie is samuel l jackson who delivers his usual solid performanceas a fan of movies this film is really poorly executed and as a fan of marvel i was extremely disappointed on both fronts id highly recommend skipping this one", "i liked a little of the film i found it too short for a movie that was spent a fair amount of money ran a little of the comic has no impact being a marvel film there is not much mystery in its powers i think some of the avengers are much stronger than her but the action of the film the design of the film the plans the way they portrayed the 90s was very cool the homage they did to stan lee was very touching i did not like a post credits  but the other scene left an expectation in the air for the next film of the avengersnome maycon lira dos santos turma 2002 n\u00famero1", "just like harry potter and the lord of the rings the marvel cinematic universe was a major part of my childhood ive been a cultish follower of the mcu ever since my dad introduced it to me the experience of watching tony stark tinker his way out of a cave and end up divulging i am iron man to an entire audience of reporters jumpstarted a major aspect of my life as a girl growing up watching these movies i was looking forward to the long awaited female lead and i had such high hopes for this movie the reality of it fell flat and i fear my honest reviews fall on deaf ears as most people hear it as a complaint on the feminist aspects of the movie and a direct reflection of brie larson we deserve a better movie while brie larson has no acting abilities whatsoever i firmly believe her success in room was solely due to the fact that her face and voice are regularly void of all emotion so the role was not much of a stretch she was not the only issue the directing and the storytelling were terrible and i cant believe kevin feige let anna boden and ryan fleck massacre this story and the characters within it what happened to fury the stoic steadfast leader of shield why did they make him out to be so disingenuous and happy go lucky this is nick fury the war hardened soldier we all know and love experiencing his first glimpse of alien life on earth and they turned him into a barely affable fool who failed to bring any realistic comic relief in a movie marinated in attempts at comic relief his scenes with the cat were ridiculous and some of the choices he made seemed far fetched and unrealistic why did he bring a woman he barely knew into a secure top secret facility he had no reason to trust her she had done nothing for him they had no relationship and i thought the main goal of the movie would be to develop that relationship and rapport between him and captain marvel what was their story how did they meet why did he have her pager why did he wait so long to use it while a few of these questions were answered the relationship was forced and the rapport was stale and never developed the guardians of the galaxy developed a quick one movie relationship because they went through hell and back together within a short period of time they were arrested and imprisoned together they escaped together they get blown up on knowhere together attacked by ronin and ravagers together and end up banding together to hold an infinity stone of course they have an amazing relationship after one movie this movie did not provide an opportunity for captain marvel and nick fury to develop the relationship that was so desperately needed instead it played pretend and failed because the audience isnt stupid this movie came across as a slapstick parody of the mcu after rewatching all the movies in preparation for endgame i realized it made a mockery of the success marvel had spent ten years developing it was as if the directors attempted to poorly imitate taika waititis success in thor ragnorak and despite the fact that brie larson spent her entire press tour bashing men she spent the entire movie trying to copy the successful acts of robert downey jr and chris pratt theres a reason tony stark and peter quill are likeable theyre played by likeable actors who can pull of the hilarious one liners and quips brie larson doesnt have the likeability or the acting capability to pull that off she was a poor choice for the movie the entire character of captain marvel was a toss up between a stoic unflappable kree soldier and a jovial knockoff of well loved mcu characters you never knew which one you were going to get would she be joking and laughing in this scene or would she be serious and dispassionate that kind of jostling made the movie into a failed juggling act the tone was all over the place making it hard to follow the plot whos bad whos good and why are they laughing all of a sudden captain marvel the character was presented with no flaws while the movie was riddled with them ronin the accuser the kree leader whod spent years enacting mass genocide threatened to unseat thanos and held an infinity stone in his hand turned away when he saw captain marvel i can suspend my disbelief but not that much and not like that the movie had no true villain no true plot and was used as a vessel to force the audience into liking brie larson and her captain marvel presentation and it failed spectacularly this movie was supposed to pay homage to stan lee not brie larsons painful acting career the reason characters like thor tony stark and captain america are so well loved is because they have flaws they draw empathetic responses from the audience because the audience can relate to their struggles there was nothing relatable about brie larsons captain marvel she made a historic comic book character into a snobbish b*tch with magic hands the audience cheered when they saw thor and captain america in infinity war captain marvel will never illicit such a response if anything shell be booed it was a testament to how poor the acting directing and editing was that i consider this movie to be one of the worst movies i have ever paid money to see its an embarrassment to the marvel universe and i will be severely disappointed if brie larson and her inhuman emotionless vacuum of a character swoops in and saves the day in endgame ive invested too much time and money into this franchise to watch her single handedly destroy it i hope they kill her off", "ive liked brie larson in other films but she showed zero range in this when your main character in a superhero movie is unwatchable you already have a problem in addition captain marvel has no weaknesses which kills the tension immediately there is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing or any danger at all for that matterits an ok origin story but it makes no sense as to why shes supposedly so powerfulthe cat was good", "i couldnt believe how boring this movie was the acting is horrible the action is terrible and captain marvel herself is super cheesy this is the worst marvel movie for me alongside ant man and the was", "do you enjoy watching a movie in which the main character has the same facial expression throughout the entire movie if yes then this movie is made for you otherwise stay away from this horrific movie the excuse is they rushed this for endgame but still couldnt have a worse job there isnt a single enemy or moment in the movie where you feel that the hero is in any danger the origins of her powers still make absolutely no sense and this movie answers no questions and just tells you that this happened and accept it without any background ive honestly never been so bored at a cinema in my entire life id give it 3 stars but the acting drags it down to 1", "1 bad storytellinga lot of people dare i say a majority of those who pay to watch a superhero origin story want to see how their favorite character got to be a superhero not how they kick bottoms after they become one2 bad character developmentpeople dont like it when in the course of introducing a new character some of their beloved established characters are made fun of or act differently3 bad idea in general p people dont like it when the source material is changed to further a political agendaand4 bad promotionpeople dont like it when theyre told by the lead actor in the movie that their opinions dont matter", "there is nothing to look forward to in this movie the story is so bad that dark world would seem watchable", "this was definitely the weakest of all the 22 marvel movies to date at the rock bottom of the list it was arguably the one that deviated the most from the comic book source material and not in the same good way that civil war ragnarok age of ultron iron man 3 and spiderman did had the least character depth and development particularly with captain marvel herself had the weakest direction lighting writing pacing musical score sound effects etc nick fury is diminished to basically being the comic relief for a lead who has only 3 emotional ranges the entire movie frustrated snarky and confused action scenes are poorly choreographed dimly lit and shot in that shaky camera youre part of the fight style thats basically guaranteed to make the viewer not know what the heck is happening so many plot holes that are so huge you could fly a hundred quinjets through them by the end the audience wasnt cheering and clapping remember toward the end of the first avengers movie where hulk tosses lori around like a rag doll but were groaning shaking their heads whispering wtf under their breaths and checking their phones to see how much more of the movie was leftthere are some good moments mainly the scenes where samuel l jackson or ben mendelson or goose the cat are in but these are very few and far betweeneveryone i saw the movie with are praying that avengers endgame isnt ruined by captain marvel being in it and were praying for the future of the mcu if marvel plans to make captain marvel their standard bearer moving into phase 4 thats how bad cm wasdisney marvel   please do not let these writers and directors near another mcu movie live and learn from this one fans are all willing to give this one a pass but if movies like this is what we have to look forward to captain marvel will be the movie everyone looks back on as the beginning of the sad end of the mcu", "sorry captain marvel really painfully average movie that was so obviously shoehorned into the mcu to make the next phase of marvel a sad reality after seeing this i felt as if the wind were taken out from my wings endgame will be amazing im sure but holy crap i would rather watch alita another 50 times than sit through this movie even one more time was not good", "overall an ok movie but doesnt meet the high standards already set by marvel brie larson was ok she started actually being engaging during her training phase alongside jude law she started with charismatic performance with humour but this performance turned very wooden very quicklysamuel l jackson was the best performer by far but this movies plot writing has ruined his character fury was the head honcho of shield and avengers who had presence and weight but here he is portrayed as being inspired by captain marvel even tho she didnt earn that level of adoration whatsoever also how fury lost his eye was pathetic and disrespectful to his character he is shown cowering holding a cat during a gunfight which annoyed me because its just not a true representation of nick fury at allcaptain marvel   carol danvers although showing potential at first shown zero character development or significant arc she remains unjustly cocky throughout and un engaging for most of movie and ridiculously overpowered for no real reason other than she absorbed an explosion and inherited these powers for no logical reasonoverall a decent movie fantastic cgi with de aging effects but definitely not rewatching or buying on blu ray", "im a huge marvel fan and this was such a disappointment i was bored and my mind drifted a lot during it it feels rushed and made with no love i really didnt care for the character at all or root for her even sam l jackson coldnt redeem it a total letdown and definitely the low point of the mcu", "truly shocking ive enjoyed every marvel film and then i dont know what it was just a mess from the start couldnt care scene after scene seemed just joined together and made zero sense i have only ever walked out once in my life from the cinemai tried so hard not to but in the end this was the 2nd time truly it was terrible ", "watched captain marvel the things i liked first 1 talos ben mendelson was really entertaining as the villain 2 samuel l jackson was good 3 the cat except for thatwhat i didnt like 1 everything about brie larsons performance she was wooden delivered her dialogue like she was reading off cards no charm no charisma no emotion whenever she showed emotion it felt massively forced and disingenuous she is just incredibly unlikeable and i cant believe they got the casting this wrong i hope they kill her off and an adult monica rambeau takes her place fun fact monica was captain marvel in the 80s before carol danvers was even ms marvel2 the writing good lord this film was lazily written not only was the dialogue garbage but come on did every single man in her life have to be a horrible misoginist and the super thin feminist message the kree patriarchy were holding her back the inhibitor chip and once they stopped she was unstoppable really3 they ruined several characters mar vell had one of the best arcs ever in the comics but nope shes just shot in the chest what a waste of annette benings talent the skrulls one of the best villains in marvel comics and the entire set up for the awesome story secret invasion nope theyre the good guys because we need an analogy for refugees and we already discussed monica rambeau4 thats how fury lost his eye screw you movie5 boy howdy they messed up the marvel timeline so they were shield in the 90s i thought coulson didnt have that name until 2008 shes the inspiration for the avengers nah man that is cap so fury knew about aliens already why was he so shocked by the chitauri and the asgardians ugh this movie was so lazy it was like theyve never seen a marvel moviein conclusion this movie was terrible it did real damage to the mcu and will continue to if shes the face going forward i thought to myself while watching this you know if you guys hadnt run off joss whedon he could have made this movie amazing no one does strong female characters as well as joss buffy the vampire slayer dollhouse and the women of firefly not to mention how good he wrote black widow in avengers 1 to being a 3 dimensional character and not just eye candy this movie proved that marvel still doesnt know how to make strong female characters as the focus of a movie sure they can be side kicks but cant carry a movie compare that to dc for all their flaws dc makes killer female characters wonder woman amazing suicide squad may have been a train wreck but they nailed harley quinn how she uses overt sexuality to her advantage and she can throw down in a fight plus she is an actual 3d character and they nailed amanda waller being a cold hearted b**ch but you have to respect her mera was probably more capable than aquaman until the endif you want to watch a superhero with a feminist message supergirl on cw she is also the strongest by far in the arrow verse but unlike brie she is charismatic likeable flawed and still badass when she throws downthis movie was trash and i hope thanos kills herend of rant", "it was a waste of time the first half of the movie was average where they tried to make some connections with previous marvel movies and brought some of the old villains however the later half of the movie was a total disaster it was the worst superhero movies that i have ever watched i wasted $23 on two tickets to watch this total piece of junka big no no for someone who wants to watch a good movie", "a forced movie a silly alien cat a weak plot and most people are eating it up sm", "this certainly is a stinker special effects anno 1987 and facial prostethics worse than early star trek what happened the movie is also chock full of extremely immature  you gogirl dumb scenes on top of dumber scenes with every dumb point telegraphed and overstated to make sure you get no surprises or enjoyment lest you miss the message it seems the mouse factory more and more lately is churning and peddling political cheese as in cheesy identity politics so now to top the cheese they actually casted brie with the star wars gender wars movies black panther black power and now this tribalism pitting ethnic groups against each other and pushing gender war", "the only good thing about this movie is the 90s nostalgia other than that its a basic sci fi movie with the marvel brand slapped onto it", "i hate the way the end credits of infinity war made me feel like i just had to see this movie this was definitely a movie i could have done without seeing and a waste of money the story was boring the acting was stiff and corny it was like watching a superhero parody movie almost a comedy i laughed and cringed through the whole movie i am a female writing this review and i did not like this movie at all the part where she said ive been fighting with one hand tied behind my back which was supposed to be a pivotal moment for the movie was the most laughable moment on screen also there was no character development and very many plot holes the way nick fury lost his eye was absolutely ridiculous a cat scratchreally this move is a disgrace to the mcu", "well ive watched this movie for the record cause i had no particular expectations for it brie larson is not gal gadot and it was obviously seen in the trailers however there was a hope that such charismatic actors as jude law and samuel jackson would push it on but alas jude laws character simply didnt reveal and about s jackson i will write furtherthis movies problem is that it is not memorable it doesnt bring emotions theres no drama theres nobody to empathize its impossible to identify yourself with the protagonist for she both being a usual human and having become basically invulnerable shows no serious feelings   absolutely it looks like marvels movie makers merely were afraid to give this stone lump of good and justice any kind of real human feelings   the feelings inherent in a real human human can be weak vulnerable can lose heart can be afraid can be merciful compassionate and so on humans are not ideal and thats why they can be attractive in the movie its creators obviously forgot about a simple truth a viewer must put himself in the place of characters he must be catched by their stories here we have an unalive unreal superhero whose invulnerability and roboticness drastically decreases interest in her while superman had kryptonite while there was a drama as superman loved a mortal woman vulnerable for enemies there were mortal parents in the case of the captain theres no such thing she doesnt love anyone she is not tied to anyone she is unreal non archetypical fictional she has no roots in real lifethis movie is not a comedy too yes there were one or two funny moments with fury with mainskrull when i grinned and thats all nick fury who was a severe and contradictory character has been turned into someone quite unserious with not very good sense of humour slobbering over a cat like a baby its awfulbased on skrulls metamorphness there could be a great detective line in the spirit of for example john carpenters the thing when everybody is under suspicion and its not clear who is who but alas such a possibility to waken viewers interest was simply ruined with another questionable twistthe soundtrack is not memorable inserting of the 90 s songs is out of place it looks like they took some songs without thinking whether it would work or not basically theres no 90 s atmosphere yes some antediluvian computers were shown yes i grinned slightly but there was no feeling of nostalgia for the real 90 svisually sometimes its good at times it looks quite bad by the standards of marvel generally speaking its made with no own directors vision and style for example although zack snyders films shot for dc have obvious problems he manages to make the scenes spectacular pleasing to the eye even if theres no actionbasically this movie doesnt add anything special to mcu its very very boring origin story yes we were shown how nick fury lost his eye   and wed better not have seen that yes we were revealed that pagers story nothing special tooif she simply comes and defeats the purple titan the people whove been watching this truly great show by marvel for more than 10 years   what will they say i hope that marvels bosses will find a way to reduce the captains powers otherwise the avengers endgame may become a turning point for this cinematic universe people are getting tired of comics based films and if its gonna become a conveyer ala star wars episode 7 8 9 1017 steadily supplying mediocre uninteresting films such as captain marvel ruining the well established canon   films made for the sake of the current moment it may be the beginning of the end for so called the marvel renaissanceand well i really dont want thatps for samuel jacksons apples of youth for a few visually good moments for one or two not very foolish jokes2 1", "this is by far one of the weakest and most boring mcu movies since the black panther and what bothers me is movies such as this and black panther are only praised not because of actual talent from production actors but because they uphold social justice not only was this an sjw ridden crapfest its also very boring the lead female actress is terrible monotone and immature jude law would have been far superior as the main character waste of time and money", "while the movie was enjoyable to watch at times i felt like i was watching it just so i wouldnt become lost in future marvel films captain marvel was underwhelming regrettably i truly wanted this to be a knock out unfortunately the ko was my attention i found myself moving a lot and becoming bored  waiting for the marvel to really take flight most of the jokes and 90s pop culture references felt lackluster and forced remember that song guys here it is i felt bries performance was yawn able at best maybe mis casting or mis direction is to blame but something was off the tone felt like a juggling act this doesnt feel like a film that is to bring the fourth phase of the mcu and more like thor 2 dark world all in all blah blah blah i only read this chapter to finish the bookmaybe my opinion will change in the future or when disney gives me money so i can sell out ya friggin turds but i need more than hentai cats to stay engaged", "bad
