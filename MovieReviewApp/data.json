{"movie": [{"movie_name": "dangal", "review": ["mahavir singh phogat teaches his two daughters to be international wrestling players of india this is a simple and impressive story and they finally defeat uk on the wrestling match  i think this is indias yip man this kind of nationalism is healthy and is beneficial to all audiences without background considerations the film length is also accurate growing courses of protagonists need 160 minutes and emotional responses to their tragic mistakes are well described by the talented actors in detail audiences can fully engage in this film  a lot of asian audiences have bias against indian films that their films are just dances and songs for two hours or more however there is the perfect construction of story with minimalist use of songs and musics  this quality is higher than any japanese films of today indian filmmakers should keep this high quality of film content it is competitive to hollywood films at the end of the film it is full of enlightenment the most important thing in life is not thing but it is a human relationship with emotion if you are true to your families goodness and emotion youll find the best solution of your problem even though you fail in this way your family relationship will only be enhanced as the result of your effort and sincereness this what this film tells you  thank you", "dangal is a masterpiece a terrific film that stays in your heart and remains etched in your memory much after the screening has concluded a brilliant film that restores your faith in hindi cinema actually it wont be erroneous to state that dangal is the finest film to come out of the hindi film industry in a long long time and mark my words it will be remembered as a classic in times to come it blends drama emotions sportsmanship and patriotism extraordinarily\u0085 the icing on the cake being aamir khans towering act this rich in merits film has a major advantage too    the holidays ahead christmas and new year    which will ensure a glorious run at the ticket counters a must must watch", "i saw this with my family in a theatre awesome experience aamirs acting effort n most importantly his passion is what makes his cinema so damn unique first thing dangal has going for it is aamir khan aamir khan gave arguably the best performance of his career playing phogat he is the best actor in bollywood period he shocked me by his transformation i myself being a gym trainer knows the effort which goes in such kinda transformation without aamir i dont think this movie could have achieved what it has the child actors were good too the music was good the direction by tiwari was the best of 2016 this movie was never boring and full credit shud go to the director the cinematography gave you a feeling as if what you are watching is real overall you dont have to like wrestling or know wrestling to appreciate this movie its a wonderful movie the movie is written very well superb screenplay n crispy editing", "aamir khan shines in the role of mahavir singh phogat he is so outstanding in his performance that this could be considered as one of his best works ever the opening scene of the film is just a glimpse of phogats passion for the sport \u2013 wrestling the first half of dangal works exactly like a skilled wrestler \u2013 invariably sure of its moves the films second half is all about victory mahavirs transformation from the once upset father of a baby girl to the most triumphant one to geetas string of losses before she finally wins a gold during common wealth games to desi akhara being replaced by wrestling mat \u2013 every moment works in contrast to what you had watched earlier but not even once does the film loses its focusa word here about mukesh chhabras casting he has done a tremendous job of the casting nitesh tiwaris direction is amazingly terrific amitabhbhattacharyas lyrics are great pritams music is in terrific sync with the mood of the drama dangal dangal is a very inspiring song and will soon become a rage dhaakad and haanikarak are also very well tuned the gilehariyaan song has terrific charm of a different kind amitabh bhattacharyas lyrics are great the song writer may pick up some awards for his lyrics bosco  caesars choreography is very real pritams background music deserves distinction marks the actors who play the young geeta and babita zaira wasim suhani bhatnagar do a competent job of maintaining the audiences attention and both shaikh and malhotra carry it forward especially when they spend a lot of the second half on the mat learning how to lose and above all to win since it encapsulates the historic win of the phogats who bought india glory so it is bound to inspire women dialogues are absolute gems without being overtly long they are so effective that they invariably touch the heart before reaching the ears on the whole\u00a0dangal\u00a0is not just a movie it is an experience to be cherished the film is destined to be one of the biggest blockbusters of indian cinemaas it content oriented so the movie is both for the single screens as well as for the multiplexes and people of all age can watchso this movie is a must

start first of aamir sir has done it again he really has a good taste in selecting movies not only the acting even the fighting scenes were quite real to me & reel geeta and babita were just too awesome there is certain moments where youre gonna laugh out loud get anger get emotional and obviously feel proud the most thats what the movie brings out of itself i hope this movie brings joy to all family and a chance to look at all daughters of theirs potentialshould you go for it hell yessongs are smartly enough and pretty amazingps i wished the movie to be a bit longer", "director mr nitesh tiwari work is so brilliant that after few minutes you just forget that you are watching film you simply start witnessing the journey of phogats family makers are so confident that they have even given credit for story idea to divya rao which reflects their honesty she is not in writing team but gets her due credit there are four writers director himself piyush gupta shreyas jain and nikhil mehrotra and their work is fantastic screenplay is seamless and very balanced with much needed freshness film starts with glimpse of mahavir singh phogats passion for wrestling while watching and challenging another district level arrogant winner while commentary comes over on them which is fresh when that person gets defeated he says tumne district level pehlawan ko haraya hai then mahavir singh replies  tension mat le tum national level champion se hare ho words may be a bit different but meaning was same which gives strong idea that what level of dialogues you are going to listen and they have maintained the graph dialogues just nourish your senses inducing correct emotions a simple scene where protagonist massages feet of his sleeping daughter clearly reflects that he is just not a ruthless coach but a caring father too girls curse their father in front of their friend who is getting married then that girl emotional words about her feeling towards their caring father is very cute emotional and enough to make girls realize that what they are taking for granted best part of this film is its continues ascending graph in every aspect first half is cute funny with subtle dose of emotions second half takes this graph to the horizon full of emotions either it is of defeat victory or relations another major plus point is the way they have shown wrestling i dint know a bit of it but i enjoyed all wrestling matches like it was my favorite game and that is major chunk of film hats off to the team behind wresting choreography though you have basic idea of film happenings but still they kept you engrossed by presentation climax comes with a very strong message that one can train you but only you have to implement the techniques which makes you true winner and enriches self confident performance makes you thunderstruck words can not justify or compliment amir khans performance as mahavir singh phogat zaira waseem as younger geeta is brilliant she is so good that when fatima sana sheikh takes over as grown up geeta you miss younger one but soon fatima proves that she has taken the graph far ahead same happens with younger babita played by suhani bhatnagar and grown up by sanya malhotra skashi tanwar as wife of mahavir singh is very good girish kulkarni  who had played coach is superb you do hate his character but love his performance actor who played younger cousin of geeta and even grown up one both actors are cute and endearing kudos to casting director mukesh chhabra and team music by pritam and lyrics by amitabh bhattacharya are integral part of this film without any formulated track you just enjoy every song and your eyes get mois in one too", "just came home after watching the premier show it really is a masterpiece a compelling narrative based on a true story add stellar acting performances and humor pour in cinematography location songs & meaningful lyrics voila everything amazingly fits together in a single string truly clean entertainment in all sense of the word worth watching with family a good movie should entertain a great movie must connect and connect it did i could almost feel as if i were there throughout the plot development is deep and engaging did i mention the child actors especially the one portraying geeta outstanding performance by all in a nutshell my time & resources spent were fully worth and aamir khan boy he never disappoints =", "excellent movie stellar performance by aamir khan movie of the year the girls   kids and the grown ups portrayed their role very well special mention should be given to nitesh tiwari   the director music by pritam is good the cinematography is nice the story telling is superb overall very nice movie watch this movie for aamir khan hands down to aamir his role as mahavir singh phogat will be marked as one of his best this film will come as one of the best sports films based on the life of coach after chak de and iqbal i strongly recommend this film wish other actors think like how aamir khan thinks he is brilliant actor that makes him special and perfectionist my rating 10 10", "story 9 10 a very true inspiring story of former wrestler champion mahavir singh phogat whose dream is to win a gold medal for india in wrestling but he fails to achieve that then he avow that his son will do it however he got disappointed when his wife gives birth to four daughtersmusic 9 10 amazing very touching background greatly synced title track will give you goosebumpsdirection 9 10 nitesh tiwari achieved what he wanted got a new name one of the best directors of bollywoodacting aamir khan 10 10 this time as a father he will amaze you in every scene his acting skills are deeply great whenever i watch aamirs movies i feel his acting he loves acting and entertaining the world since he came to the film industryfatima sana shaikh 9 10 sometimes i still watch chachi 420 because i love kamal hassan and fatima sana shaikh was the little girl in chachi 420 seriously i have seen her after chachi 420 and after dangal she will go so faraamir khan and the two lead actress are the best cast roles in a long time but overall cast done an amazing jobdangal is humorous and inspirational journey", "mahavir singh phogat is a former champion wrestler he is married to shobha kaur phogats dream is to win a gold medal for india in wrestling he is unable to do this he promises that his son will do what he couldnt do however although he loves them dearly phogat is disappointed when shobha gives birth to four daughters he does not believe girls can wrestle well however when two of his daughters geeta and babita come home after beating up two boys phogat realises how wrong he has been and begins to train his daughters in wrestling the film is the story of how phogat trained his daughters to become professional wrestlers", "my dangal review thoughtsin the moments of tension i believe everyone exhibits their own unique body language to deal with nervousness and anxiousness mine involves folding hands christian style i am worried that i folded my hands for so long during the film that had i done the same in a temple i would have been some shah rukh khan myself yes  the film is that excellent in its portrayal of the sport that it makes you grudge every time a player lands back first on the mat we are so used to applauding action set pieces in other films that it will be criminal if the action choreography for dangal goes unappreciated this is the best and most realistic we have ever donethe whole cast is so great that i cant do anything but wonder why we need the glam actresses for each and every big filmwhy not some sakshi talwar the new faces do wonders when it comes to making the illusion of cinema feel true and when aamir the superstar sheds former self to becomes some chachajaan it adds to the illusion instead of taking the magic away i am bound to praise aamir but that guy has lost that element of surprise to make you go wow he is just aamir being aamir in yet another film thatll be brought in his already long good list this is what happens when you submit yourself to the script and director <= full marksmost sports film are marred by clich\u00e9s its impossible to evade the conventional trappings of the genre dangal has its fair share of those but the biggest thing is that it knows when to stop and thats what makes it a stadium like live experience my adrenaline rush was high and it made me very nostalgic as i got reminded of cwg delhi days when i was 24*7 glued to dd sports at this point i feel my review is deviating from its path so i will put breaks by making a concluding statementthis is aamirs chak de india i am speaking this both figuratively and literally    but who in the right mind would mind another one of those", "i got the privilege to watch this film earlier than the india release as i happen to live in north america thank you disney now what to say about dangal its not a typical bollywood film yet it is easily the best bollywood film ever even in terms of every so called bollywood masala trick the incredible storytelling based on true events every small detailing amazing cast the message it had without being preachy or pretentious but still powerful there was not one single boring moment in the movie well probably one if you are too pickythough it is nearly three hours kudos to the director and what to say about aamir khan though he did not have any dramatic moment in the movie those belong to the girls who were fabulous by the way he is not the charming usual boy next door sexy or cheeky personthe traits which are generally associated with aamir khan rather he is a brute has a tummy for the majority length of the movie yet you will not be able to keep him off your mind even after the movie ends and easily the best aamir khan performance ever and yes i have seen every aamir khan film each a million time", "this movie proves that india is not yet ready for an honest biopic film although the film excelled in every other aspects such as acting cinematography special effects music especially music but it couldnt capture the real aspect of the story of the wrestlers daughter and her sisters we never get to know her enthusiasm towards wrestling was it her relationship with her father who imposed his dream of winning a gold on her or her duty towards her nation to win it or was it her own desire to never give up or lose to a competitive opposition to satisfy her own egothis film was heavily clich\u00e9d just for the purpose of entertaining the masses and clearly may have aggravated many characters who are related to this story too much hype may have given this movie the attention that it pursued and why not this is business after allmuch disappointed with the makers of the film for adulterating such an awesome script which may have had made everybody proud current imdb score 92 with over 13k users where have we gone wrongfinal verdict its a good watch but one wouldnt rate this movie 9 10 unless he she had any personal attachment towards the film it has good social message dialogues an 8 would be too generous hence i would rate it 6 or 7 out of 10", "its conceivable that a wrestling movie might have you on the edge of your seat but whod have thought it would bring tears to your eyes dangal does both in large doses right from the opening scenes through to the awesome climax this is one movie that will keep you glued to the screen i cant remember the last 3 hour movie nearly where absolutely nobody took a toilet break apart from in the intermissioneverything about the movie is superb from the cinematography through to the script writing the movie is superbly directed and there are so many stellar acting performances that it would be unfair to single anyone outone thing about sports movies is that the action can often seem staged but the fight sequences in this movie are superbly done and brilliantly filmedeveryone knows an ak movie is going to be great and this definitely doesnt disappointa must watch", "nitesh tiwari amir khan and the team has put an extra ordinary effort to make such an intelligent blend of inspiration emotions and humor that standing ovation at the end is irresistible dangal has a very unfamiliar high level of detail which is too good for bollywood high detailing make actors live the character which doesnt go unnoticed and dangal proves this point each actor wasnt just playing the character they were truly living it it was the phogat family viewers saw on screen instead of the actors that makes dangal stand out acting is brilliant by both the lead and supporting actors mr perfectionist was great like always no words to describe his level of commitment special mentions are the debutantes fatima sana shaikh sanya malhotra and zaira waseem all the wrestling scenes are perfect and viewers cant mistake them for actors the way these girls portrayed the characters of the wrestlers geeta and babita is commendable and worthy of every award story was based on a true story and the director stuck to it with some slight additions to make the movie more emotional and enjoyable which is good for bollywood audience but as a critic i must say there was a little bit of over dramatization in the end also i want to mention that ak and nitesh didnt include any usual romantic crap and dance sequences which must be appreciated casting could have been better fatima is too cute for geetas character and this matters a lot while making a biography but she minimized this shortcoming by her flawless performance movie is 2hr40mins long but its well crafted so its enjoyable ____________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ its a must watch movie and amir khan keeps on setting standards for other producers of bollywood which makes us hope for a better future of movies in india", "aamir khan is back after pk as a wrestler who wants his daughter to win the gold for the nation it is a biopic of mahavir phogat and believe me its a must watch biopic to get inspiration to achieve something you have to let go the rest of the thingsa simple story with great performances make this film a worthy watch aamir khan is as usual fantastic but the girls are true heroes of this film fatimah who plays geeta is a sure shot winner she looks exactly as per her character and delivers great impact as a wrestler younger girls of geeta and babita are also very fine sakshi has a small role but she plays it safely aparshakti khurana is doing a voice over here and plays a role of the girls cousin brother he is funny and entertains the audiences for sure girish kulkarni is also there who delivered a classy performance in ugly so the star cast and their performances are the biggest point of dangaldirection and writing by nitesh tiwari are worthy enough for viewers as they dont get bored in any situation except one after interval song that is like something slow paced everyone has to applause him as he gives justice to phogats family and doesnt add any extra material which we often see in bollywood movies he has delivered the frame as it is so the middle class viewer can easily be able to connect with the film what i like the most in the film apart from the performances is music pritam has given it with the lyrics of amitabh bhatacharya both were amazing in ae dil hai mushkil this time also they are killing the stereotypes i loved all the songs im downloading it hanikarak bapu and dhakad are pitch perfect they have some english words as well as some pure hindi words in them which make them enjoyable but the best song is by far the title track in the voice of daler mehndi full marks to the music departmentyes it is very emotional film those who get the connection easily with films may cry during some scenes even im one of them too it is better than sultan because its a pure wrestling movie with a family background sultan was like a love story with a background of wrestling till interval and then box fighting post interval i wish dangal may cross the record of sultan at box officeon the whole just go and enjoy the perfect film with your entire family as many time as you can btw i will go for the second time for sure so 2016 has ended with a perfect film jai hind", "dangal 9 10 is the kind of film for which the 70mm medium exists it has universal appeal is technically brilliant and more than anything else it is a film that skillfully balances popular sentiments and realism it is going to reach tens of millions of people without having compromised the quality of storytellingan extraordinary story of some extraordinary people who not only conquered their fears but also a society which had the negativity to kill their dreams even before they were bornif chak de was a fine example of exemplary editing in a sports film and pan singh tomar was an exceptional sports film with great depth and realism dangal would forever be remembered as one of the best indian sports film for the sheer reach it will have wrestling is a fast paced technical sport to make the whole thing look as authentic as it has looked in the film it would have required some meticulous planning and extensive training and they have done it really wellthe fact that you feel the frustration that mahavir singh phogat feels in the final scene and you along with the whole audience begins to clap after each of geetas winning bout as if there was a live game at display shows how supremely engaging the film is one negative though not significant enough to harm the film is that it has over dramatazied the narrative at the cost of slight misrepresentation of the factsonly if the majority of indian film makers could realize that it is not impossible to make good cinema with popular appeal we would start getting more than just a couple of hindi films every year worth watching now is a good time to list top films from india in the sports drama genre 1paan singh tomar

all mr khans most emotional film and as always a perfectionist as everto end a great step to lightened the darker side of the societ", "dangal   its such a good thing that both pink and dangal  two top movies of this year are women centric its such an improvement for bollywood which doesnt make movies on women because such movies doesnt make money  which is a wrong fact  pink made almost 300% profit you just need to make a good movie and it will make you money and by saying women centric m serious the character of mahavir phogat is not the real hero of the movie  rather its his daughter geeta phogat who is in the center of the movie for understanding what mahavir phogat has achieved in his life  we must know the fact that hariyana is one of the worst state in india for girls a very low sex ratio and a very low literacy rate for women and in such scenario what mahavir phogat has achieved is tremendous that said  one thing is clear that we cant expect anything out of the box which we always get from amirs movies like 3 idiot  pk and talaash  because its a biopic  so they have to show what actually happened  which is not exactly bad things  in fact what this movie shows is an out of the box real life story first i would like to mention two things which i dont liked 1st   the way the wrestling coach of national sports academy has been shown as one sided villain also who is kind of incapable to train  was wrong 2nd   there was an unnecessary twist in the end which seems unconvincing apart from these two things  everything else is either good or great in the movie the movie tackle through different themes sometimes it tackles them one by one  and sometimes simultaneously but the good thing is that it tackles them convincingly for example when we see mahavir training his daughters rigorously  there comes a thought that what kind of dad he is he just stole the childhood of her daughters to fulfill his own dreams but after some scenes on the wedding of mahavirs daughters friend both the daughters complaining about mahavir her friend who is getting married reply that she hoped that she would had get such father as mahavir who thinks about their daughters and wants them to achieve something and not like his own father who force her to marry at the age of just 14 to an unknown person that particular scene convince the audience that what mahavir is doing is not wrong as compared to the society where they are living another theme which movie showed very convincingly was how free a girl feel when she goes out of his family for the first time almost 1 hour of the movie contains wrestling matches and those matches were done extremely well on technical level  and hook you like you were watching a real match i mean as compared to this the matches show in sultan were just nothing among the performances zaira wasim also the lead actor of amirs next secret superstar playing young geeta was delight to watch the scene where she request her father to not cut her hair and she will do anything he wants was heartbreaking and she does her fighting scenes very well considering the fact that the director in an interview has mentioned that zaira was actually the weakest among all the four girls before they start their training but when it comes to fight scenes  fatima sana sheik as the older geeta was best she fights like a real fighter and her hard work is visible on the screen on her dramatic acting front she was awesome too both the actresses who played young and old babita were good too  but got less screen time as compared to geetas character aparshakti khuranabrother of ayushman khurana as the nephew of mahavir has an impeccable timing of comedy  and surly will make you laugh many time but for amir khan  what to say  he blends so nicely  that he became mahavir  and the actor amir is nowhere visible anywhere he just makes me wonder why cant other actors yes pointing at srk and sallu stop showing their persona and blend into characters in their movies  around the whole movie there were so many whistle blowing happening  that i was not able to here the dialogues many times but just before climax  the national anthem runs in common wealth games after geeta phogat won her gold medali hope thats not a spoiler and the whole theater stands in respect of national anthem you just cant help and get overwhelmed 94 10 by anup apu kuma", "its a movie decked up with the classic acting of the veterans and the novices and bore the testimony of the unorthodox approach to bring to light the dream of mahavir phogat the fire of dangal ignited in the hearts of the sisters which paved the path of demolition of gender discrimination the film portrays the affectionate bonding of a father and a daughter and emotional rendition escalates barriers when the elder sister has kept the very words of her fathers dream in fact it is beautifully carved that our ignorance towards our family elders hinders our progress the film has been peppered with humour every now and then and it has added extra spice to the viewers", "honestly i was a bit determinant after watching sultan thinking that this film could be a remake but honestly after watching this movie it was a lot different this movie just melted my heart with the fantastic writing direction performances and editing nitesh tiwari brought 2 average films which were bhoothnath returns and chillar party but for this film he deserves a bow for the amount of hard work he managed to put for this filmthe performances in the movie were absolutely phenomenal aamir khan is back to becoming nuanced and self confident khan we always admired his fat to fit video really created a lot of inspiration for me and my friends and that increased our eager level in watching this movie sakshi tanwar is a pretty decent actress her role was absolutely strong and withheld but her dialogues in certain places were quite awkward and almost out of placethe girls who played geeta and babita just kept me to the edge of my seat what amazement these girls did and how they used their empowerment to pull of a male sport with such easethe screenplay and direction was something i really loved just like how haryana was shot and how the wrestling scenes were shotafter ae dil hai mushkil i managed to enjoy priams music but the songs in dangal were average and i wouldnt consider them at loop listening soundtracks not many songs really stand out as suchhonestly i enjoyed this movie much more than sultan based on its true story and fantastic direction overall this movie is a masterpiece with beautiful direction performances and acting this motion picture really touched my heart leave your house and grab your tickets this is definitely a cinema watching moviein any society it is very important to understand the meaning of women rights no matter how boyish something could be women are considered human beings girls have the right to do anything ranging from being a police officer to a taxi driver these are typical jobs that mostly men pull off but women can also pull these jobs off but much quicker try to understand that men and women are the same professional wise", "amir khan a person always amazes everyonerecently he is working for movies with a good moral lesson and a worthy basethat kind of movie is a movie dangal is a good example it has a classic taste and digestible fun which peels off the people eyes it is a true story full of suspense and when youre watching a fight you feel like you are wrestling in between this kind of quality is difficult to be produced and amir is good at it the reason for giving 9 stars is because of its ending i think it should be made better by showing scene like he is putting that medal at the wall of honor anyways keep it up i was expecting this a thing from you love you ", "i am aware that many people would not like to read my review i have no doubt that the movie viewing experience with its emotional pot boiler roller coaster ride engages and is a good one better than the indian regional and vernacular soap opera dished out on indian television that is why i am giving 7 out of 10 ratingbut if a sensitive person looks beyond the cosmetics of movie dazzles \u2013 you will find someone is selling a regressive message through this film kodus to dangal team for achieving such a feat here is my takewhen the first poster of the movie was released i did not like it even though being a wrestler why four girls should look like boys was the first question i raisednow after reading so much appreciation and reviews of the movie i say this\u0095 this is another patriarchal portrayal of regressive india \u0095 a father forces his dreams on children one should never do \u0095 children should be kept free to develop and grow as they want \u0095 this is again patriarchy dominance on the feminine gender and forcing it with the power of parenting to subjugate the flourishing of womens gender \u0095 for sure the flourishing of womens gender is not in imitating men and or boys and becoming fighters wrestlers and looking masculine this is degrading the pride dignity and respect of being a woman \u0095 to use a true success story of a single case and successfully use it as propaganda for womens emancipation is sickening to say the least the negative fallout of this movie could be \u0095 irrespective of boys or girls many parents will force their children and more so to girls to do what they failed to achieve in life make their children do things that they as parents have dreamed sick mentality \u0095 many girls may start behaving like boys   wearing boys dress cutting hair like boys fighting like boys etc etc not at all in the spirit of humanism \u0095 father in the movie saying that my girls are no less than boys such comparisons are not needed in todays evolved society this is a phrase of sixties india it is similar to always call a girl tom boy and demean and insult her sexuality such comparisons just distort the femininity of girls and women who mis understand such statements as being treated like boys rather than girls \u0095 addressing girls as a male gender and treating one like that   the society like india   parents may do that to destroy the little bit of remaining self esteem that girls and women   have on their given gender and sexuality \u0095 i also am bothered   as i always tell everyone about it is man   in capitals that drive the so called womens emancipation and empowerment agenda   it is so disturbing to see this the four writers of the movie are men the director of the movie is wearing mens glasses the so called super star gender sensitive actor amir khan is too wearing a mans hat\u0095 in propaganda of spreading regressive message through this film the team too is of men   the director writer producer and lead actor   all men   who drive to influence the society in a way that may create a distorted image of what is meant by women empowerment \u0095 in real life on which the movie is based the father of the wrestling girls drives their lives such case studies should have been presented more sensitively by showing \u2013 such things need not be done \u2013 even though in the end it brings laurels for the country though i agree the medium of cinema when used with shrewdness can garner enough emotions within ignorant movie goers about nationhood to back the protagonist in whatever s he is doing that is what has happened in this movie   the art of good film making  tends to overlook and ignore finer aspects of women empowerment and digs more deep into the patriarchal systems to further strengthen patriarchal roles to build the womens liberation and freedom movement i hope some readers who are sensitive human being will try to understand the point i am making and deplore such popular presentation of regressive concepts on feminism despite its all time record breaking all india collection it confirms my review   indian is still a patriarchal society with male dominancehave a look at the film with those lenses", "story  good screenplay  good direction average actors all acted ordinarily except aamir who was above average due to few heart touching scenes music effective goodtoo much hype by patriots not knowing a good movie from a bad who are simply echoing the same words uttered by the bollywood celebs for their friend aamir i felt the movie was very predictable with lots of scenes were altered from reality for entertainment purposes yes it has emotions comedy action etc but is not a true movie at all except a few scenes such as fight sequences i believe a lot of people are just going to watch this due to the word of mouth coming from other bollywood celebs promoting the movie left right and centre the whole of india if not the world had more time at their hands due to the holiday season and everyone from marketing team to film producers directors actors friends media just went all out promoting this movie for aamir and his production house and all they did is enjoyed people spending their hard earned moola on this average movie"], "sentiment": 0.2623205484450107, "tmdb_review": "an inspiring feel good true story about fighting for a dream that only you can see  most importantly this movie dares to put up a fight fighting against old indian traditions and female prejudice    two daughters overcome heavy obstacles to become world famous indian wrestlers with the support and motivation of their father and trainer    it is a very colorful well made lighthearted entertainment the acting is fine and the characters are relatable     a drawback is that it is way too long for a one night movie and should have been made into a mini series     overlooking the abuse aspect  i think it is important to say that personally i dont agree with most of the methods the father used to train strengthen and harden his daughters as a lot of actually was serious child abuse their mother also acts as the passive typical enabler to make it worse the movie dismisses and jokes about the psychological hurt on the daughters as if it didnt do any damage in europe the father would have been jailed and the kids taken away by cps  i think it is a big misunderstanding to glorify abusive behavior but i guess indians still have to learn that you can motivate your children without abusing them", "tmdb_rating": 0.04686371100164204}]}
