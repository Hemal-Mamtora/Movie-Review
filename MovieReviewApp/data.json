{"movie": [{"movie_name": "rockstar", "review": ["not every movie needs to have tadka its a movie which is pure from heart and honest it doesnt speak about anything other than attraction which cant be explainedsure it has its flaws but if you can look over them and watch it with a warm heart it stays with you well after you have left the theater hats off to imtiaz ali for daring to break the shell jab we met was fun to watch and a good movie but rockstar shows how much depth can be reached in a romantic movie without even saying the l word even onceeverything said watch it if you appreciate good cinema and not because you are looking for a stereotypical complete bollywood package", "rockstar is a film made once in a lifetime hats off to imtiaz ali for story ranbir kapoor & nargis farkhri for scintillating performances ar rahman & mohit chauhan for great soundtrack & background musicrockstar is a must watch film itll leave you feel good hangover of itself this movie shows how love stories should be made this movie has something which is hard to see in other hindi bollywood films something which would make you think about the whole movie even after so many hours of watching it watch it deeply and youll enjoy iti loved the movie and enjoyed it thoroughly after so watching so many movies this year id say watch it again if youve seen it onceverdict dont miss itacting & performance 9 10story 85 10music 10 10overall 9 1", "first of all rockstar is not a mere love story for those people i saw drawing conclusion that this is just an extramarital affair which is justified by imtiaz ali its much more than thatwhen the character of protagonist was getting built it was told to him that it would be pain that would get the star out of him movie is journey of making of a rock star who goes through pain of separation depravity from society which makes him someone he was never meant to be but finally a rockstar a true blue eyed boy who was always away from any sense of pain in his life until he falls in love and tore apart life of his and love of his life heeri am although not a big rock music fan but got food for thought for those posthumous rock stars that lost their lives to depression and drugs this film gives gray shades of their tainted life which is always open to so much of public scrutiny which perhaps helped me to recon with their hysterical behaviorit starts with a young lad trying to make big in music but who doesnt have soul to sell himself as a serious artist he has shown a way through love and betrayal and he fancies his chances with the most admired girl of the town little does he know that this would embark an endless journey of pain for both which would see its penultimate end being both leads battling for their survival literallyi dont wish to discuss movie dynamics in length as this is not about how the script has been written with without conviction the real sense of conviction in this movie comes through ranbir kapoor he lives the character of jordan and gives performance of his life time not in for a second you would think for the entire movie that he is a movie star you would watch him struggle through his pathos kudos to him for pulling this off with such great ease i couldnt imagine anyone doing this role and leave the same impression nargis who is the leading lady in this movie looks no less than an angel in movie and gives a performance for which any new comer can feel proud about especially against such a strong character played by ranbir kapoorof all the loudest praise should go to two people ar rehman for his genius music and to mohit chauhan this movie is as much a milestone for him as it is for ranbir kapoor both mohit and ranbir jells so well that its hard to believe that actually ranbirs voice is backed by a singer its a compliment for both of them every song stands out and they all are superbi thoroughly enjoyed this journey of making of a rock star this movie is not about making a right statement to society and not to follow the footsteps of protagonist its about how much pain it goes in making a real rock star that makes everyone feel on the cloud when he couldnt ground his foot correctly movie is dark in nature and this is about an anti hero jordan who dont have sense of righteousness and he vents out his anger in form of music a picture perfect depiction of a rebel rock star to the corewatch it if you are in for dark movies dont expect any bollywood masala but an intense tide of emotions throughout", "even though the indian film industry releases countless big budget films every year only once in a while there comes a movie like rockstar which moves away from the usual story and casts an impression on the viewersimtiaz ali has created such a masterpiece this time his story is a fresh take on romance and pain and he has shown he is one of the best directors aroundthe story revolves around 2 characters janardhan jakhar aka jordanranbir kapoor and heernargis fakri and their feelings towards each other the special thing about this movie is that despite being a love story the lead characters never act as the clich\u00e9d loversthey never said i love you throughout the movie and still their love was so intense and powerfulthe self inflicted pain of jordan is the soul of this movie and moves the audienceranbir has done a remarkable act and has again proved he is an exceptional actor in the film industry his transition from the innocent and confused jj to the ruthless shattered jordan is flawless the audience were in awe of him throughout the movie and rightly sothe music blends with this movie perfectly and most of the time lifts the movie to higher levels the voice of mohit chauhan along with the expertise of ar rahman is just superb and this duo will be in demand for a long time the joy enlightenment pain and suffering of jordan is portrayed very well through the songs and this is one of those movies in which you feel that the songs werent just forced in the storydespite everything being so good there was one shortcoming nargis the model turned actress had weird expressions in few scenes in her debut film this created some funny moments in the first half but she did a convincing act post intervalone thing which the director couldnt balance was the pacethe first half was expanded into few years showing the pairs love and relationship but post interval they didnt do that and stuck to a straight and small period with longer scenes this gave most of the general audience an idea that it was slow if the story in between intervals was balanced in terms of the time span more people would have appreciated the whole moviethis an emotional and an intense journey of a simple man who goes on a path of self destruction a must watch this movie needs deep understanding and appreciation", "love stories have always been bollywoods thing a trifle here and there might have changed over the years but the formulaic love story the one that weve all grown up on and savored always takes you by the hand guides you through the films ups and downs and leaves you at an ending but when you have a story as new as fresh and as free falling as the one in imtiaz alis rockstar then these are times that herald a new change in todays bollywoodthe story goes something like this janardhan jakkadjj aka jordan a delhi simpleton has always wanted to be a rockstar his friend mentor and college canteen manager khatana gives him a get your heart broken and you will be a rockstar solution jj automatically aims for the prettiest chick on campus heer sure to have his heart broken but what follows is a story that goes from a simple one of fame mongering to a love story most unusual the chapter of jordan and heer never seems to end and their complexities take them on a path that would ultimately destroy their livesit is very difficult to characterize the movie with a single emotion it is so beautifully layered that it will take repeated viewings to form a consensus within yourself as to why you love the film just like its soundtrack rockstar is a movie you will have to allow to grow on you the film can best be described as a heady cocktail of love and fame and how each has an effect on the other its the free falling nature of the story that gives it a feeling never before experienced in indian cinema the movie borders on self indulgence every once in a while but wonderfully balances it out with realismthe music composed by ar rahman is in many ways a character in the film every phase of jordans life is characterized by a song which magically sets the tone for the next few minutes till the next song or sequence comes along and changes the mood the music in many ways drives the film its very obvious now why imtiaz ali replaced usual collaborator pritam with rahman without the type and scale of the music rahman has given for this film rockstar would have been very handicapped the music truly forms the soul of the film also from the snow covered mountains of kashmir and himachal and the dingy discotheques to the old architecture of prague and the various concert venues the film looks beautiful in almost every shot thanks to ace cinematographer anil mehta the right variations in angle color and focus gives the film a biographical feel where the scenes portray an emotion as much as the actors in them dowhich brings me to the performances the film has few characters and each of them are well defined aditi rao plays the journalist sheena who tracks jordans life and though she has precious little to do she plays her part piyush mishra as the shrewd record company owner dhingra is the quintessential greedy man in the film and does well too kumud mishra as khatana jordans old friend and manager is perfect and brings in a certain sincerity and authenticity to his part shammi kapoor as the shehnai maestro ustad jameel khan is absolutely charming every time he appears on screen it is hard to miss the glint in his eye and these being his last shots will always be what rockstar will be remembered for now for the two lead actors nargis fakri is unfortunately the weakest link in the film she obviously has a lot to learn in the acting department she blatantly disappoints in scenes where she is required to do more than just look pretty and ends up as the cold dish in rockstar nonetheless she does look good in every frame and with better acting could go places with her current form she will find it tough to make a markhowever rockstar completely belongs to ranbir kapoor who has clearly gives this film his all he plays his part with utmost perfection and with a depth that is so rare in bollywood these days through the film it is jordan and not ranbir kapoor that we see on screen he earnestly brings out the character transition from jj to jordan with such ease that this could very well be his career defining performance hes clearly left his contemporaries way behind ranbir kapoor as of now owns bollywoodhaving dared to make such an experimental film director imtiaz ali is truly the new age doyen of indian cinema his refreshing take on love stories from jab we met to love aaj kal continues with rockstar which will be remembered for a long time as the first movie of its kind truly original and truly inspired from all the right sources imtiaz ali is the new age phenomenon of modern love in cinematruly magical and spell binding rockstar leaves you with a feel good hangover of itself that is hard to digest at first watch id give it a 4 5dont miss", "even if you ignore his surname for a moment ranbir kapoor is arguably one of the most naturally talented actors in todays bollywood in addition to this his good looks ensure female fan following read rake in more moolah his rockstar may have just been his most intense and splendid performance till date rockstar begins at a concert in rome and someone scuffling with ruffians it is soon revealed that the someone is jordan a major rockstar labeled a bad boy by the media and someone who hardly smiles cut to his college days theres the simple janardan jahkar or jj strumming his guitar and singing for the local audience and his days in the college canteen gorging samosas and idolizing jim morrisonwhen his well wisher and canteen manager katana played impressively by kumud mishra tells him that a true artist needs to be driven by hurt and anguish jj curses his simple and incident free life just to get his heart broken he chases the college bombshell heer kaul nargis fakhri eventually it turns out that under the prim and proper exterior heer is thrill seeker and the two become wild friends what begins as a fun filled friendship takes different shades as the time passes on one hand heer drowns into depression without our hero whom she re christens as jordan and jordans yearning for her company brings out the performer in himin what is probably the best portrayal of what goes on in a creative head the story brings depth and makes its audience feel for jj despite the negative publicity he gets as jordan hes a simple guy who yearns for love noticeably it is only after his tryst with heer that his motive in life changes from chasing success to something else during the process success merely becomes a byproduct he is least interested in director imtiaz ali plays around with the storys chronology it is likely that the editors too may have actually lost track in between repeated scenes songs and too much of flash back or forth gets annoying after a point the restlessness among the audience was very apparent as the movie seemed to go on forever talking of performances ranbir surely has a line of awards waiting for him nargis fakhri the american with pakistani antecedents who plays the leading lady is truly beautiful and has been a kingfisher calendar girl but not as gifted with acting skills the film also marks shammi kapoors last screen appearance as he plays an ustaad who recognizes jjs talent aditi rao hydari plays a small role as a journalistar rahmans music is integral to the story and songs have already become runaway hits sadda haq kun faya kun jo bhi main with mohit chauhan as the rockstars voice and katiya karun give the album an eclectic blend of rock desi flavor and sufi mysticism again some more awards are in the waiting herecinematography too is well done especially the jerky shots and quirky angles that capture the actors emotions effectively be it the by lanes of delhi picturesque europe or breathtaking beautiful kashmir winter the excellence with the camera is undeniable the realistic costumes complement the camera work the dialog is very smart and the first half evokes laughter and stands up ably as things turn serious in the second half you may blame the script for some of its flaws but asking for perfection when portraying emotions and out of the ordinary relationships is a monumental challenge so to say its a job moderately well doneso should you be watching this movie the answer is a resounding yes granted the story gets a little lost in the second half but the rest of the goodies will make you overlook its flaws the movie is powerful enough to keep you thinking much after you are out of the movie hall if you still havent seen it go for it", "jordan is sitting among prostitutes and strumming his guitar as they sing together    when his manager pulls him out onto the street soon a crowd engulfs them and starts chanting jordans name their voices drowning the sound of the manager pleading with the musician to get his act together this is what i have always wanted jordan says looking at his screaming fans but i am not happy insideimtiaz alis rockstar is a bittersweet journey of a man an artist from being an everyman to a superstar but while ali uncovers layers off jordan the iconic musician    each layer as fascinating as it is intriguing    he keeps the core of the character janardhan jakkad alive he hurts like anybody else falls in love like anybody else and also has to deal with moments of sheer frustrationand all of it finds release in music music is jordans identity its what makes him rich and famous but to jordan thats incidental in the end his artistry is what connects him with himself for a hindi film viewer that is a fascinating story to watch unfoldthen theres the opening shot a tribute to indias original rockstar shammi kapoor from there on its a tumultuous ride \u2013 one with its highs and lows one that has anguish as also love one that has pain but also a sense of fulfillment and a brilliant finale    not a conventional one but effective nonetheless    which leaves you feeling like the characters themselves incomplete but content like an effective crescendo that leaves you wanting morethe music itself is a delight each ar rahman number is lilting and woven beautifully in the story the high frequency of songs not hindering the storytelling but enhancing the experience lyricist irshad kamil does an outstanding job penning words that reflect the lead characters state of mind and complement situations aptlyimtiaz ali in trademark fashion though isnt content with focussing on the complexities of a troubled musician he gives us a dose of romance too and a generous one at that estrangement from family lack of fulfillment in life and self discovery apart what really drives jordans music is his relationship with heer fakhri beautiful but awkward volatile as the affair is its also what keeps jordan sane and heer alivefor about 15 minutes in rockstar the narrative tends to resort to bollywoodism true love having the power to cure a terminal illness almost for example doesnt exactly fit with what the rest of the film has to say the story tends to meander a bit post interval but imtiaz makes it work eventually interweaving the fantastical romantic part of the film with the more gritty dark bits deftly in the end how much you enjoy rockstar will largely depend on whether the balance between the tale of a broken discontented musician and the more conventional love story works for youit did for me    though i would have preferred the former    but you cant deny imtiaz credit for his mastery over the romance genre no contemporary filmmaker has dealt with man woman relationships with as much dexterity his films often tread a similar path the lovers are usually confused meet at different points in life and theres always the other man but his fresh approach to each story is what makes them immensely watchablewith rockstar imtiaz goes beyond his own tried and tested format his ambition to narrating a more complex story coming through this is probably his most personal film and his honesty as filmmaker is hard not to be affected by hopefully he goes the whole hog next ditching the genre hes adept at to trying his hand at something entirely out of his comfort zone rockstar is also imtiazs most technically polished film and he benefits from the association with cinematographer anil mehta and editor aarti bajajranbir kapoor has been hindi cinemas next big thing for a while now with rockstar he lives up to the hopes pinned on him to deliver big ranbir revels in jordans complexities another actor may have found it to be an obstacle the character arc undergoes constant transformation and he adapts suitably it wouldnt be an understatement to say that ranbirs portrayal of jordan may go down as one of hindi cinemas most accomplished performances by a lead actor just to see him work his magic on screen rockstar is worth a watchbut while good acting is always an incentive its a directors vision that makes a film truly watchable and imtiaz makes rockstar stand out from what the mainstream churns out every week and brings back the one aspect sorely missing from hindi films lately    music", "prosabrupt start and unfinished endalways

farreally i always admired him as a directorand this movie  though has glimpses of his previous films that were super hits   love aajkal and jab we met but the second half is totally offbeat and different yet really refreshing the screenplay is like one i have never seen beforejust like an a grade english movie a lot of people have criticized this movie unable to understand the way imtiaz has told this story what a beautiful love story id say dont go for this movie expecting a love aajkal or jab we met  keep a free mind and enjoy imtiazs fresh way of showing you some love", "jj aka jordan   ranbir kapoor rockssaddaaaaaaaa haqqqqloved rockstar movie a lottttttttttfrom screenplay to story or direction to music n above all acting from the all the character is like mind blowing will be watching it again tomorrowthis is not a feel good movie and i know a lot of people will not like it but yes it will make you think even after the lights are onthis movie is the best film of 2011rk is amazing and arr score rocksdeserves all major awardsoverall an outstanding film which is connected to most of usrating 9 10oh ya ya ya yo yaaaaaaa", "indian cinema has matured and specially hindi film with new directors pouring in with new ideas anurag kashyap dibakar banerjee vishal bhardwaj should get special mention for their brilliant coming of age films after rockstar imtiaz ali should be added to this category of filmmakers romantic cinema is immortal perennial but never ever it has been witnessed in such creative symbolic real manner as in rockstar rockstar is journey of janarthan a regular north delhi brat who dreams of becoming jim morrison he even tries to match his initials with the famous singer and tries to change his fate alas he couldnt succeed in making a mark when a college canteen owner who becomes family for janarthan later on khataria tells him that through pain comes music janarthan took his word too seriously thus involving in a web of suffering and success all revolving around heer a lady who becomes life for janarthan rather jordan the movie is a journey of a young ambitious boy from his being janarthan to jordan and in a symbolic manner raises several questions about independence and democracy imtiaz ali is a fabulous story teller and his previous work reflects those but with rockstar he goes a level higher the film will bring polarizing reactions from cine goers but they cant ignore it probably one of the best romantic cinemas ever made ali is almost flawless in his execution with a semi non linear narrative ali goes into the psyche of jordan merging his scenario pre and post success the scene where jordan cries in front of khataria that he doesnt need all the fame he wants to be happy \u2013 sums up jordans strive with his impression the rebel has been created in a thought provoking manner raising questions to establishment the rules set in the society the willingness to live freely how power has destroyed the regular course of nature \u2013 all these ideas have been embedded subtle in a brilliant love story that is natural unlike loud melodramatic blockbusters of regular hindi cinema when jordan is almost losing heer forever there is a scene which shows jordan in a bath tub looking at his guitar on fire which reflects the life of present youth who tends to burn loss everything one loves in course of success there are many more such brilliant sequences which show alis craftsmanship as a director with able support from anil mehta the camera work is probably the best of this year ali didnt compromise for commerce and gave a surreal feel to the real proceedings kudos to aarti bajaj for her apt editing and making the film a work of art coming to the acting department ranbir kapoor rocks he camouflaged himself as jordan with \u00e9lan rockstar will prove how fine actor he is in fact the new brigade of actors should take acting lessons from ranbir watch his transition from janarthan to jordan his success his failures his love his despair \u2013 ranbirs expression deserves awards and accolades teaming up with fabulous actors like piyush mishra kumud mishra who was last seen in brilliant that girl in yellow boots ranbir showed extreme maturity in a sequence where he tore down a contract and made hysteric gestures towards piyush mishra deserves standing ovation those dialogues showing alis angst against consumerism deserves mention nargis fakhri as heer is serene beauty any boy will fall in love with her as an actress she needs to improve but then she isnt bad either piyush mishra as the opportunist dhingra simply rocks as usual kumud mishra is surely to catch attention of other directors the ensemble cast provides ample support in their brief and significant role lastly how can one forget the original rockstar late shammi kapoor in a significant appearance as a successful classical sahnai flute player he is mind blowing and how can i forget about rehmans music in the film each of the songs are mark of a genius and brilliant in their own space with awesome lyrics from irshad kamil the musical score elevates the movie to another level nadan parinday is one of the best written songs of recent times and sadda haq had all the power to be the youth anthem simply brilliant album in every sense overall rockstar is a outstanding work of art that might not appeal to every many but sure to be the next kagaz ke phool in the long run though rockstar is already a hit thankfully a genuine honest effort deserved its box office report a classic in the long run\u0085rockstar rocks", "after seeing trailer movie looking like as old movies of ranbir but this movie is surprise package for me great acting and great music with nice lyricsstory as like old movies of imtiaz ali nice and differentpeople are telling confusing might they dont have enough understandingmusic is awesomear rehman is bestlyrics is also goodbest acting of ranbir with awesome look of rockstar nargis is looking good but acting is ok shammi have very short role we can remember as a last movie of himalready watched 1 time bur wanna going for more times must watch movie go and see", "for me it was the most awaited movie for this year especially after listening to the awesome songs first of all the music rehman and irshad kamil did fabulously well the music and songs were totally different from the regular bollywood styleranbir was terrific and this was truly his best performance till date he looked so natural that sometimes you feel that you are watching a live shot documentary or somethingimtiaz alis direction as always was very good he has a different style of making movies and this movie is a great example of that though my personal favorite from his lot is love aaj kalthe only loose part in the movie was nargis she was not up to the mark and some very good scenes and situations got spoiled because of her poor acting skills and especially when pitted against the flawless ranbir she looks pathetic to say the least so without disclosing anything from the story id say its a great movie and you surely cant afford to miss it", "ranbir is committed in his disturbed desi rocker avatar and his abstention from any intoxicants makes him an idol who wouldnt corrupt his worshipers nargis blends divine beauty with lips that jive like shes in the movie finding nemowatching rockstar once is like watching it many times over thanks to the repeated montages that sporadically recap the film if you thought being stabbed once was bad heres what a knife set can dothe film drives home an unscientific hypothesis that people whove endured sufferings  heart break  loose motions etc will reach their creative best by this logic each person in the audience will be blessed with superhuman creativity as they step out after watching rockstar oh yeah yeah yeah go n watch out u cant miss d ", "this is seriously imtiazs best film yet when the movie end i kept asking myself how is it possible to narrate a story like this story wise absolutely amazing what you guys will see in the trailer is just 1% of the movie ranbir kapoor was amazing too balancing the right emotions at the right time some amards should be waiting for him now definitely ar rahman stole the whole movie with 14 top charting music every music suits the story every single time well he isnt called genius without a reasonfor me its the best album of the year and potentially the best movie if the year all credits goes to imtiaz ali for such great story content", "lately i have had to go through the trauma of watching some rubbish money motivated bollywood flicks such as the prolonged bodyguard and the hideously scripted ra onehowever rock star is just on another level it is the most gripping bollywood film of the year it reminds me of movies like rock on dil chahta hai rang de basanti because this like them is not a clich\u00e9d story it is out of the box and very very different from the monotonous chocolate love flicksthe best part of the movie was that there were no non sense songs all the songs made sense and were perfectly timed the music by ar rehman is absolutely brilliant apart from that it is very well directed the way the director has played with the time line is marvelous the time line keeps the viewer glued to the screen for instance the start of the movie is showing jj or jordan at a massive concert and then suddenly you see him as a struggling visionary artist during his college life trying to imitate famous rock starsyes the movie basically is a love story but an extremely gripping one unlike most bollywood love stories you see how jordan becomes the star he is due to this love story that is what makes it so special 2 plots working side by side complementing one another ie him becoming a star due to his passionate love affairthe facial expressions of both ranbir and nargis add to the spice you actually feel they are in love the intensity of their relationship is very evident due to the acting nargis despite not having her own voice has done an outstanding job and ranbir kapoor has stepped up a notch from his other brilliant performance in rajneetiit is one of those epic movies you cant afford to miss if you are a fan of wonderfully scripted biographies then this one is definitely for you however if you enjoy over the top action stunts or illogical comedy then dont watch itmy recommendation to all purists out there do watch it i cant believe the rating of this movie is only 76 which is most likely to dropthrough all this i have learned one thing through this movie the indian cinema has shown signs of maturity however through the rating the public has notranbir kapoor and nargis take a bow  extremely brilliant performance ", "film when you think about a film by imtiaz ali you only see an entertainment tag to a film and also very good script writing but seeing the promos of rockstar made me think what imtiaz is up to now after giving a great film like jab we met and a mediocre film like love aaj kal i was expecting a cheesy love story with a good entertaining factor i wont say this movie doesnt have any cheesiness but yes its in a very low dosage people going for just entertainment will actually love half of the movie people going to see a romantic flick will love the whole film there are some very good comic punches in the film and some very humiliating parts too i wont use any spoilers but yes the first half is full of comic scenesacting ranbir kapoor is at his best here after giving a great performance in rajneeti this guy has shown his serious part again in more of sadder way nargis fakhri is very good to look at most part of the film you will just look at her and wont even hear what anybody is saying but when you see her talking the jaw just falls down she does not have those acting skills at all its like the start of katrina kaif again but she has a great future ahead of her for sure kumud mishra and piyush mishra never disappointed in their acting both did a great job especially piyush mishradirection & cinematography now the direction was really top notch in this movie it was particularly flawless in every aspect imtiaz has a tendency to deepen the character development and he has done this with great enthusiasm the character development of the rockstar is very good and keeps you on your seat the cinematography was also great from the walking sides of delhi university to the scenarios of kashmir and prague was immensely intriguingstory the story of the movie had some parts that all hindi romantic have usually for a time you would wonder of a yash raj film being shown but the turn of events and the whole movement of the story were good the only problem being that the whole movie was a drag stretch this movie if made shorter would have gained more audiencemusic i would say the music by ar rahman is damn good from jo bhi main to tum ho the scores are really beautiful and stays in your head for a very long time sadda haq already being the favorite among the youth has a good adrenaline rush factor in it the movie being pretty much mediocre the music actually makes the movie very goodverdict i would go forfilm 7 10acting 7 10direction & cinematography 6 10story 6 10music 9 10overall 75 10the movie has been given a great artistic touch to it which is hard to see in a bollywood film such that it makes you think about the whole movie even after 24 hours of watching it give it time to indulge in your mind it will actually get to your soft spot and you would say the movie was really sad", "rockstar is a beautiful painting on a canvas its a journey through the soul of a musician mellow and bitter sweet its not a feel good movie or even an actual tale it has gaps as glaring as a 30 foot wide goal post but rockstar has a soul and that keep you fixed to the screen long after the goal i liked rockstar for three reasons ar rahman the visuals and ranbir kapoor a r rahman has weaved magic and the music would be stuck in your head long after the movie saddha haqis raw and full of energy and will gets your fists pumping in the air the visuals are simply scintillating there would definitely be more indians holidaying in prague and kashmir now anil mehta deserves the kudos for the cinematography kashmir will take your breath away but the lapses quickly bring it back rockstar has great humor its refreshing to see bollywood have well written clean and neat humor its funny and does leave you in splits the ideology that only pain begets music is a little retarded though the movie progresses at its own pace with the music and visuals rockstar is not a statement or even the tale of most rock stars it just isar rahman music is alone worth going to the film soulful and very sufi in nature the 14 tracks in the movie are simply a testament to the genius he is the rawness of the music has an addictive aura to it and will mesmerize you ranbir kapoor i must say has matured into a fine young actor with \u00e9lan and crisp he blends the several layers of his character seamlessly into one hes not acting hes living it imitaz ali has definitely grown as a director since jab we met & love aaj kal rockstar is loosely based on a friend of his but he manages to pen it right this is definitely not his best work but it pulls through what you will find hard to digest is the logic used that leaves you numb aarti bajaj could have edited rockstar better to make it edgy but you would not want to change that because you would risk hurting the soul of rockstar nagris fakri is the new katrina kaif and has done an outstanding job considering that this is her debut shammi kapoor spoke with his eyes and what a tribute it was to him rockstar is no dabaang or singham not a movie for the masses but it appeals to you rb has the charm to keep you stuck to the screen frankly rockstar could be the perfect cure for the ra one hangover its not a great movie but it will suffice to rid of the week its a half baked chocolate cake who cares its chocolate anyway baked or half baked", "watch it for ar rahmans heart touching songsextraordinary performance

is an enchantment to watch that how indian cinema is up and coming with some different subject matterjanardan jakhadjj a regular lad with vehemence for rock music and die hard fan of jim morrison goes to an indistinct length he was recommended by his mentor that to become an eminent artist there must have occurred a catastrophe and pain deep in heart the efforts to break his heart are very funny with some witty dialogs and great body language by ranbir eventually nargis fakhris screen presence is a cool breeze she is striking but lacks in the acting skills she missed the expressions and unable to deliver nevertheless having a counterpart role the supporting cast has done very well special mention for kumud mishra katara & piyush mishra dhingrathe first half of the movie shows the character development of jj with some fine moments of mirth and splendid cinematography however the second half drags a bit with some no obvious reason deeds ranbir adds a new feather is his cap with outstanding performance he shows a great potential in every movie with a different shade he is going to take the kapoors legacy to a whole new level ultimately the music given by our own oscar winner a r rahman is exceptional and soul of the movie every score is blazing with the correct situation rahman is a genius and kudos for compiling such stupendous music which will remain in our hearts until the world ends imtiaz ali has given us some fantastic movies including his best my opinion socha na tha and with rockstar he chooses a very fine and daring subject waiting to see more from himmusic 95 10 acting ranbir 8 10 story 6 10 direction & cinematography 7 10film   75 1", "first up i want to say as a gleeful child i sat in the theater and wanted to give as much chance as possible to like rockstar because i was mesmerized by the sheer musical brilliance of arr that being said even if i went in with a hate mood its difficult not to like this imperfect masterpiece imperfect not in the way it was handled but its an imperfect story about an imperfect man inside every star first half there are three main things for a life to sustain a creator a soul and a body to host the soul and thats where rockstar is blessed in having a brilliant director in imtiaz as its creator a soul in arr and the surprisingly perfect body to host in ranbir people who didnt like ranbir for the rich spoiled kid he is must realize if he has this much acting talent he can be as much spoiled he can be  the story is simple its the life and lies of janardhan jakhar aka jordan its how a innocent guitarist who wants to make big goes throe pain and when he becomes popular that same pain engulfs him so much that he doesnt know how to handle it credit has to be given to the director for creating two wonderfully unique halves that are so diff from each other the first is about the wonderfully tender relationship between janardhan and heer its so innocent and realistic that the first half flows as faultless as a river about the heroine narghis fakhri i agree she has been the real letdown in this film but her acting was not bad as such she was shown up by the beast of an actor opposite to her who was living the role of his life in ranbir second half now coming to the second half the half which many did not like it speaks up about the ordinary guy in jordan the star wanting for thing to be as simple as it was when he wasnt a star its complex i agree and it glorifies a lot about infidelity which is still the unspeakable when it comes to indian cinemas but its brave its new and it definitely touched me i have seen countless movies brilliant till climax and faltering in it and when dealing with a movie as complex as this i could see imtiaz coming up with 100s of ending for this but in the end he played to safe made it a musical tribute to that janardhan jakhar inside jordan advantages of having an open ended climax is that it lets us decide what we want and in the end keeps everyone happy but being brought up with bollywood the indian inside us wants the director to end it one way or other another reason why open ended climaxes rarely work in bollywood coming to acting of other cast its difficult to single out anyone in particular because every frame was so dominated by ranbir but kumud mishra  katana bhai pips over nargis just because of the chemistry he shares with ranbir odd to say a third person has more of a chemistry with the hero than heroine but thats the sort of unique film this is now i conspicuously avoided mention about the music till now because the sheer f**king brilliance of arr deserves a separate paragraph now titling a movie rockstar everything could go wrong with the music but arr showed us how everything can be made right with it how every gap can be filled how every untold story can be told and how an untold climax can be ended now i surprisingly had the privilege of watching this movie is escape with english subtitles and that for me made all the difference from making this a nice film to a masterpiece starting from the summary of the hero in jo bi mein to the mild subtle variations of katiya karun as the lead pairs relationship to the beautiful parallelism in hawa hawa to the wonderful connection between coming of age song sadda haq and the climax song naadan parindey to the haunting back ground musics of tum ho and aur ho arr has lived and breathed life in every frame of the movie i have seen countless indian movies never have i seen a theater full of audience sing along with every song only the brilliance of arr turned the usually etiquette filled sathyam audience into a maniacal rockstar audience i read in an interview with arr that he and imtiaz spent 3 years in conversation about this movie and its music and this kind of movie deserves that depth as the end credits roll on we see the lead couple romance in all the places they have been since the start of the movie and to have that vision of how to end the movie when beginning to shoot shows imtiazs vision this is that kind of movie which i can type endlessly about the story plot but i cannot do justice to that movie experience you get sitting inside the theater verdict another indian movie that is too futuristic for its generation too complex to understand and too imperfect to be loved another movie i hate to see get flopped but destined for it anyway a movie to be watched in a theater worthy of handling its musical nuances and with an open mind and with english subtitles for no obs like me", "rockstar is one of the best movie of 2011 it has the much needed thing called a story movies like this release once in a blue moon the movie is directed by imtiaz ali  the cast has a young actor ranbir kapoor supported by d\u00e9butant nargis fakhri the music is given by the oscar winning musician arrehman and songs are sung by mohit chauhan janaradan jakhar ranbir kapoor \u2013 his friends at hindu college call him jj \u2013 is a rotten seed for his ultra conservative family so all he receives at home is scorn and ridicule the owner of the college canteen where the young man whiles away his time day dreaming over endless plates of samosas tells him he cannot be the path breaking musician that he wants to be until he experiences genuine pain and heartbreakjj finds both love and loss in the form of the rich and statuesque heer a kashmiri girl who blows hot and cold as he mutates into a rockstar jordan a rebel is bornread more at http  moviesndtvcom movie_reviewaspxid=673&cp nargis fakhri as the seemingly straight laced but wild at heart girl who decides to give vent to her repressed desires before her imminent wedding also hits the right notesnargis fakhri as heer has done an excellent jobranbir kapoor as jj makes a go for it with infectious intent he gets the lingo and diction right the gawky gait is delightfully aptar rahmans outstandingly lively and eclectic musical score presents a wide range of sounds blended into a harmonious whole ranbirs shammi kapoor act on a boat on the dal lake he sings chand sa roshan chehra is probably worth the price of the ticket if the recently deceased bollywood icons cameo in the film isnt moreover writer director imtiaz alis sensibility ensures that rockstar for the most part steers well clear of the clich\u00e9s that usually hound the average bollywood love storythough there are many flaws in the movie but ranbir with his performance covers it up verdict   awesome movies guys just watch it ratings   9 10", "i have to say that watching this movie alone in an empty movie theatre added several dimensions to the whole experience of watching rockstar my first comment is to imtiaz ali   what were you thinking bro to actually have the gumption to create a love story around the idea of ethereal and eternal love as envisioned by the great sufi master rumi in the land of dabangg and bodyguard did you really think that audiences read the common man would throng cinemas and multiplexes to get a taste of sublime lovefor sublime love is the thread that binds this beautiful bitter sweet tale together it is a love story written in the idiom of northindian kashmiri sufi culture of dargahs of spirituality of delhi university campus insider jokes of the topography of north india especially kashmir and i fear the film could be condemned with the e word  elitism the starting point of the story is a young ordinary low middle class callow youth who is a wannabe singer strumming his guitar to ordinary lyrics hoping to make it big he is accused of being shallow by his mentor and advised to seek out pain in order to light the creative spark that divine glow that accompanies great art unbeknownst to him his casual and frivolous flirtation with this search for angst leads him into the deep end where he has to come face to face first with true love and then with the inevitable pain that comes with it the dialogues are fabulous so is the cinematography the snow clad mountains of kashmir and the misty mornings of new delhi the green fields full of flowers in prague place the story in the here and now when in truth the story could belong to any era any century any epoch the universality of love the self realisation that comes with it the realisation that this life is but a dream is what the movie is really about the essence of the story is not in the physicality of love but love beyond the here and now beyond right and wrong and love for the creator who was there when there was nothing elsesee what i mean when i ask imtiaz  what were you thinking bro and now for the piece de resistance the music the lyrics the singer if there were any doubts being expressed by the hoi polloi about a r rehmans diminishing creativity well then here is his rebuttal the music is earthy rooted in our traditions and culture and designed to rock its astonishing how rehman is able to dive into the musical traditions of the punjab to create the saada haq and katiyaan karoon irshad kamils lyrics if you take the time to listen to the songs and understand the words are beyond compare mohit chauhans voice is eminently suitable for all the songs my favorite is naadaan parinde ghar aajaa listen to the lyrics and cry we have been enjoying a lot of junk food lately now its time for some haute cuisine", "the concept of presenting the strength of music has been totally upgraded and has been lifted to a great level \u0085 a r rehman has proved and ensured that not always audience can take a break during any song sequence in indian bollywood movie i would love to see a live sadda haq of mohit \u0085 duet of rehman and mohit in kun faya kun & nadan parinde deserve top marksi didnt went for this movie with any great expectation but the direction in first 10 15 mins of the movie gave my money back \u0085 rest was just free of cost world class entertainmentvery first thing i did after i was back from the movie was i checked the profile of imtiaz ali what a direction and script mr director \u0085 it might not appeal to masses but is surely a feast for music lovers and phenomenal acting as in how well a character can be presented it was like rocky on adrenaline \u0085 not a single moment in the movie was getting drown down \u0085 one perfectly executed scripti was fed up with all those hollywood remakes \u0085 but this presentation was really impressive all stars to rockstar", "rockstar saddaaa haq finally after a long time bollywood present just gr8 movie just an awsm movie this is calling must watch movie if u dont watch u miss really gr8 make by imtiaz ali boss rock & music hmmmmm just tremendous work by ar rehmaaaan & mohit chauhan rock and also ranbeeeer kapoor doing such a fabulous acting i think this is a limit imtiaz ali set a scale for all the directors spectacular story & way of screenplay direction  timing of songslocation costumeslooksmekup every thing in just an awsm way must watch if u dont like movie i pay for it  promise dont miss  rockstar is a film made once in a lifetime i thoroughly enjoyed this journey of making of a rock star this movie is not about making a right statement to society and not to follow the footsteps of protagonist its about how much pain it goes in making a real rock star that makes everyone feel on the cloud when he couldnt ground his foot correctly movie is dark in nature and this is about an anti hero jordan who dont have sense of righteousness and he vents out his anger in form of music a picture perfect depiction of a rebel rock star to the corewatch it if you are in for dark movies dont expect any bollywood masala but an intense tide of emotions throughout"], "sentiment": 0.26591464568060275}]}
